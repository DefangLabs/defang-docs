## A Tool to Develop, Deploy, Debug

Defang is a radically simpler way for developers to develop, deploy, and debug their cloud applications. Defang enables you to easily author cloud applications in any language, build and deploy to the cloud with a single command, and iterate quickly with AI-assisted tooling.

### Develop

The [Defang CLI (command line interface)](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli.md) includes an AI-driven agent that translates natural language prompts to [generate an outline](/docs/tutorials/generate-new-code-using-ai) for your project that you can then refine.

### Deploy

Defang can automatically build and deploy your project with a single command.

    - If you’re new to Defang, you can try deploying to [Defang Playground](/docs/concepts/defang-playground.md), a hosted environment to learn to use Defang with non-production workloads.
    - Once you’re ready, you can [deploy](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-your-cloud) a project to your own cloud account - we call this [Defang BYOC (Bring-your-Own-Cloud)](/docs/concepts/defang-byoc.md). We offer support for the following cloud providers:
      * [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-aws)
      * [DigitalOcean](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-digitalocean)
      * [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-gcp)
    - To support stateful workloads, we've got managed storage options such as [Managed Postgres](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-postgres) and [Managed Redis](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-redis). 
    - If you want, you can also [bring your own domain name](/docs/tutorials/use-your-own-domain-name) for your deployment.

Defang takes care of all the heavy lifting such as configuring networking, security, [observability](/docs/concepts/observability.md) and all the other details that usually slow down the average cloud developer.
It also allows you to easily [publish updates](/docs/concepts/deployments.md#deploying-updates) to your deployed application with zero downtime.
   
### Debug

Once you've deployed, you can use our AI agent to help [debug](/docs/concepts/debug) your cloud applications, using your service logs and project files to help you identify and resolve issues.
