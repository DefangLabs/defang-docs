## Develop Once, Deploy Anywhere.

Defang lets you take your app from Docker Compose to a secure and scalable deployment on your favorite cloud in minutes.

Any App, Any Stack, Any Cloud.

### Get Started Quickly
The [Defang CLI (command line interface)](/docs/intro/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli) includes an AI agent that translates natural language prompts to [generate an outline](/docs/tutorials/generate-new-code-using-ai) for your project that you can then refine. Or choose from our [library of over 50 samples](https://defang.io/samples/) covering all major frameworks and technologies.


### Deploy with a Single Command

Defang can automatically build and deploy your project with a single command.

    - If you’re new to Defang, you can try deploying to [Defang Playground](/docs/concepts/defang-playground.md), a hosted environment to learn to use Defang with non-production workloads.
    - Once you’re ready, you can [deploy](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-your-cloud) a project to your own cloud account - we call this [Defang BYOC (Bring-your-Own-Cloud)](/docs/concepts/defang-byoc.md). We offer support for the following cloud providers:
      * [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-aws)
      * [DigitalOcean](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-digitalocean)
      * [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-gcp)
    - To support stateful workloads, we've got managed storage options such as [Managed Postgres](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-postgres) and [Managed Redis](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-redis).
    - If you want, you can also [bring your own domain name](/docs/tutorials/use-your-own-domain-name) for your deployment.

Defang takes care of all the heavy lifting such as configuring networking, security, [observability](/docs/concepts/observability.md) and all the other details that usually slow down the average cloud developer.
It also allows you to easily [publish updates](/docs/concepts/deployments.md#deploying-updates) to your deployed application with zero downtime.

### Debug

Once you've deployed, you can use our AI agent to help [debug](/docs/concepts/debug) your cloud applications, using your service logs and project files to help you identify and resolve issues.
