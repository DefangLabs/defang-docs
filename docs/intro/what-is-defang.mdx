Defang is a radically simpler way for developers to develop, deploy, and debug their cloud applications. Defang enables you to easily author cloud applications in any language, build and deploy to the cloud with a single command, and iterate quickly with AI-assisted tooling.

- Develop: The [Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli.md) includes an AI-driven agent that translates natural language prompts to [generate](/docs/concepts/generate) an outline for your project that you can then refine.
- Deploy: Defang can automatically build and deploy your project with a single command.
    - If you’re new to Defang, you can try deploying to the [Defang Playground](/docs/concepts/defang-playground.md), a testing environment for learning how to use Defang.
    - Once you’re ready, you can [deploy](docs/category/tutorials) a project to your own cloud account - we call this [Defang BYOC](/docs/concepts/defang-byoc.md). Defang takes care of all the heavy lifting such as configuring networking, security, [observability](/docs/concepts/observability.md) and all the other details that usually slow down the average cloud developer.
    - You can also use Defang to easily [publish updates](/docs/concepts/deployments.md#deploying-updates) to your deployed application with zero downtime.
- Debug: Once you've deployed, you can use our AI agent to help [debug](/docs/concepts/debug) your cloud applications, using your service logs and project files to help you identify and resolve issues.
