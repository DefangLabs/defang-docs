# Deploying from GitHub Actions

Defang makes it easy to deploy your applications directly from your GitHub Actions workflow using the [Defang GitHub Action](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang-github-action).

There is a dedicated tutorial for deploying to each cloud provider:
* [AWS](/docs/tutorials/deploying-from-github-actions/to-aws)
* [GCP](/docs/tutorials/deploying-from-github-actions/to-gcp).
