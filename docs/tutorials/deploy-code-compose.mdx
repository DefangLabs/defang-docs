# Deploy Code Using a Docker Compose File

This tutorial assumes that the code normally gets built into a container and has a Dockerfile file in the current folder.

If you already have a Docker Compose file for your service(s) you can use it directly. Here is a tutorial that shows you a simple example of how to deploy a node.js service using a Docker Compose file and a single js file.

# Step 1 - Create main.js

Let's create a simple node.js service which listens on port 3000 and returns a welcome message. Create a file called `main.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Welcome to Defang\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});
```

# Step 2 - Create Dockerfile

Let's create a Dockerfile to build the node.js service. We'll use the official Node runtime based on Alpine as a parent image. Create a file called `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node runtime based on Alpine as a parent image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Run the app when the container launches
ENTRYPOINT [ "node", "main.js" ]
```

# Step 3 - Create docker-compose.yml

Let's create a Docker Compose file to deploy the node.js service. We'll call the service minimal and expose port 3000. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  minimal:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - mode: ingress
        target: 3000		
```

# Step 4 - Deploy

Now that we have the code and the Docker Compose file, we can deploy the service using the `defang compose up` command. This will bundle the code into a container and deploy it with Defang. If you have [cloud credentials configured](../concepts/cloud-providers.md), the service will be deployed to AWS. If you don't have AWS credentials set up, the service will be deployed to the Defang cloud.

```sh
defang compose up
```
