# Deploy Existing Containers

This tutorial will show you how to deploy an existing container/multi-container application. 

This example is rather useful if you already have a Docker container built manually, or through a CI/CD system where the resulting image is available in a public or private repository accessible by Defang.
But it is not required in order to follow along to this tutorial. 

# Step 1 - Make a Docker Compose file
:::tip
If you are unfamiliar with Docker Compose files, check out the [Compose](/docs/concepts/compose) page.
:::
Create a `compose.yaml` file to define the [service(s)](/docs/concepts/services) in your application.

If you already have a Docker Compose file to define your service(s), you can use it directly and skip this step. 


```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - mode: ingress
        target: 3000		
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - mode: ingress
        target: 4000	
  redis:
    image: redis:6.2
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - mode: host
        target: 6379
```

The example above shows a multi-container application with 3 services, `web`, `app`, `redis`.
If you wanted to deploy only one container, say `app`, then the example would remain the same, except without the `web` and `redis` services.

# Step 2 - Deploy
Run the following command in the [Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli).
```text
defang compose up
```
