# Deploy to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own GCP project using Defang.

## Prerequisites

- [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
- [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [GCP Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
- [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/) or use [Railpack](../concepts/railpack.md)

:::warning["MCP prerequisite"]
If you would like to deploy using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you like need to setup the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) with the IDE of your choice.

## Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

Head to the folder where your project is located.

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

## Step 2 - Configure your GCP credentials

After signing in to your GCP account, select an existing project or [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project). Make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). Then, note down the project ID and set it as environment variable `GCP_PROJECT_ID`.

## Step 3 - Deploy

Invoke the `defang compose up` CLI command with the `--provider=gcp` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=gcp` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang compose up --provider=gcp
```

## Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your GCP account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your [GCP Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
