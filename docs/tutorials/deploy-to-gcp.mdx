# Deploy to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own GCP project using Defang.

## Pre-requisites
* [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)
* [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
* [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
* [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
* [GCP Account Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)

:::warning["MCP Pre-requisite"]
If you would like to deploy using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you like need to setup the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) with the IDE of your choice.
:::

## CLI

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory
Head to the folder where your project is located.
```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

### Step 2 - Authenticate Defang to use your GCP Account

After signing in to your GCP account, select an existing project or [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project). Make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). Then, note down the project ID and set it as environment variable `GCP_PROJECT_ID`.

### Step 3 - Deploy

Invoke the `defang compose up` CLI command with the `--provider=gcp` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=gcp` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang compose up --provider=gcp
```

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your GCP account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your [GCP Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

## MCP

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory with your IDE
Navigate to your project directory and open it in an IDE that has the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) installed.

:::tip
If the Defang MCP server doesn’t start automatically, try starting or restarting it from your IDE settings.

### Step 2 - Authenticate Defang to use your GCP Account

After signing in to your GCP account, select an existing project or [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project). Make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). Then, note down the project ID for the next step.

### Step 2 - Setting your provider
In your chat window, type `/mcp.defang.GCP_Setup`  or select the corresponding prompt from your IDE’s options.

![Trigger Prompt](/img/prompts/gcp-prompt.png)

The [MCP prompt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) will require your GCP project ID you created in [Step 2](#step-2---authenticate-defang-to-use-your-gcp-account-1).

### Step 3 - Deploy
Once the prompt completes without errors, your chat input will be automatically populated with the deployment command for the LLM to execute.

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment
You can check the status of your depolyment by using the [Defang Services tool](../concepts/mcp#services) or you can inspect the resources created in your GCP Dashboard.
