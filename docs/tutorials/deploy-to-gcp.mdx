# Deploy to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own GCP project using Defang.

## Prerequisites

- [The Defang CLI](/docs/intro/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
- [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [GCP Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment)
- [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/) or use [Railpack](../concepts/railpack.md)

## Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

Head to the folder where your project is located.

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

## Step 2 - Configure your GCP credentials

After signing in to your GCP account, select an existing project or [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project). Make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
Keep a note of the project ID, you will need it in the next step.

Run the following gcloud command to authenticate with GCP:

```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Step 3 - Create a stack

Before you deploy, you should create a [stack](/docs/concepts/stacks). In this
case, we will create a stack called `dev`:

```bash
$ defang stack create dev
```

Defang will ask us which region we want to deploy to, and which GCP Project ID we should use.

## Step 4 - Deploy

Invoke the following CLI command. Defang will ask you which stack you want to deploy to.

```bash
$ defang compose up
```

## Step 5 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your GCP account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your [GCP Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
