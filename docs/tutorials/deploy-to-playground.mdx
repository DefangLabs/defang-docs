# Deploy to Playground

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your project to the free [Defang Playground](/docs/concepts/defang-playground).

## Pre-requisites

- [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)
- [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
- [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)

:::warning["MCP Pre-requisite"]
If you would like to deploy using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you like need to setup the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) with the IDE of your choice.

## CLI

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

Head to the folder where your project is located.

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

### Step 2 - Deploy

```
$ defang compose up
```

If you have not used Defang before, you'll be prompted to log in.

```
 ! Please log in to continue.
Please visit http://127.0.0.1:49154 and log in. (Right click the URL or press ENTER to open browser)
```

When you do this, you should see something similar to the output below:

```

## MCP

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory with your IDE

Navigate to your project directory and open it in an IDE that has the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) installed.

:::tip
If the Defang MCP server doesn’t start automatically, try starting or restarting it from your IDE settings.

### Step 2 - Setting your provider

In your chat window, type `/mcp.defang.Playground_Setup` or select the corresponding prompt from your IDE’s options.

![Trigger Prompt](/img/prompts/playground-prompt.png)

There are no arguements to this prompt.

### Step 3 - Deploy

Once the prompt completes without errors, your chat input will be automatically populated with the deployment command for the LLM to execute.

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

You can check the status of your depolyment by using the [Defang Services tool](../concepts/mcp#services) or you can inspect the the project on the [Defang portal](#defang-portal).
