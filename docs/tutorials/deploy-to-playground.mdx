# Deploy to the playground

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your project to the Defang Playground.

## Pre-requisites
* [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)
* [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
* [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)

## Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory
Head to the folder where your project is located.
```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

## Step 2 - Deploy

```
$ defang up
```
