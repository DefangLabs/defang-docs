# Deploying to Amazon Web Services (AWS) With Defang

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own AWS account using Defang.

## Pre-requisites
* [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)
* [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* [A Defang Account](/docs/getting-started/authenticating)
* [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started/installing)
* [AWS Account Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)

## Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory
Head to the folder where your project is located.
```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

## Step 2 - Authenticate Defang to use your AWS Account

There are many ways to authenticate your [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html). 
Once you've done that, Defang will look for your AWS credentials in your shell environment and expect to find one of the following credential sets:
* the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable
* or, the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables

## Step 3 - Deploy

Invoke the `defang up` CLI command with the `--provider=aws` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=aws` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang up --provider=aws
```

## Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your AWS account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your AWS dashboard.
