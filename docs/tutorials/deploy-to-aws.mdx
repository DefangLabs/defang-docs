# Deploy to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own AWS account using Defang.

## Prerequisites

- [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
- [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
- [AWS Account Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)
- [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/) or use [Railpack](../concepts/railpack.md)

## Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

Head to the folder where your project is located.

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

## Step 2 - Configure your AWS credentials

There are many ways to authenticate with your [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html).
Once you've done that, Defang will look for your AWS credentials in your shell environment and expect to find one of the following credential sets:

- the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, and optionally the `AWS_REGION` environment variable
- or, the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` environment variables

:::tip
If you have the AWS CLI installed (which is not required in order to use the Defang CLI), you can verify that you've authenticated to AWS by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` and see your account ID.

## Step 3 - Deploy

Invoke the `defang compose up` CLI command with the `--provider=aws` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=aws` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang compose up --provider=aws
```

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your AWS account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your AWS Dashboard.
