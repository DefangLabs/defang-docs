# Deploying to Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Defang

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own AWS account using Defang.

## Pre-requisites
* [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)
* [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* [A Defang Account](/getting-started/authenticating)
* [The Defang CLI](/getting-started/installing)
* [AWS Account Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)

## Deploy your project to AWS

1. Navigate to the directory where your project is located:
```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

2. Authenticate Defang to use your AWS Account

Defang will look for your AWS credentials in your shell environment.

Defang will expect to find one of the following credential sets:
* the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable
* or, the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables

3. Deploy

Invoke the `defang up` CLI command with the `--provider=aws` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=aws` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang up --provider=aws
```

4. Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your AWS account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your AWS dashboard.

For a deeper discussion of the Defang AWS Architecture, including a list of the resources we provision in your account, see our [AWS Provider docs](./providers/aws/aws).
