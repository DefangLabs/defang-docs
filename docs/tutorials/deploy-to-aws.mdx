# Deploy to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own AWS account using Defang.

## Prerequisites

- [The Defang CLI](/docs/intro/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
- [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
- [AWS Account Credentials](/docs/tutorials/setting_up_your_aws_account)
- [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/) or use [Railpack](../concepts/railpack.md)

## Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

Head to the folder where your project is located.

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

## Step 2 - Authenticate with AWS

There are many ways to authenticate with your [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html),
but we recommend using the AWS CLI `aws login` command to authenticate when
deploying from your local machine. This will create a profile with short-lived
credentials which Defang can use to deploy.

:::note
The AWS CLI is not required in order to use the Defang CLI, but it is a
convenient way to authenticate with AWS.

## Step 3 - Create a stack

Before you deploy, you should create a [stack](/docs/concepts/stacks). In this
case, we will create a stack called `dev`:

```bash
$ defang stack create dev
```

Defang will ask us which region we want to deploy to, and which profile we should use to authenticate.

## Step 4 - Deploy

Invoke the following CLI command. Defang will ask you which stack you want to deploy to.

```bash
$ defang compose up
```

### Step 5 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your AWS account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your AWS Dashboard.
