# Deploy to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own AWS account using Defang.

## Prerequisites

- [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
- [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
- [AWS Account Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)
- [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/) or use [Railpack](../concepts/railpack.md)

:::warning["MCP prerequisite"]
If you would like to deploy using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you like need to setup the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) with the IDE of your choice.
:::

## CLI

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

Head to the folder where your project is located.

```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

### Step 2 - Configure your AWS credentials

There are many ways to authenticate with your [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html).
Once you've done that, Defang will look for your AWS credentials in your shell environment and expect to find one of the following credential sets:

- the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, and optionally the `AWS_REGION` environment variable
- or, the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` environment variables

:::tip
If you have the AWS CLI installed (which is not required in order to use the Defang CLI), you can verify that you've authenticated to AWS by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` and see your account ID.
:::

### Step 3 - Deploy

Invoke the `defang compose up` CLI command with the `--provider=aws` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=aws` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang compose up --provider=aws
```

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your AWS account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your AWS Dashboard.

## MCP

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory with your IDE

Navigate to your project directory and open it in an IDE that has the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) installed.

:::tip
If the Defang MCP server doesn’t start automatically, try starting or restarting it from your IDE settings.

### Step 2 - Configure your AWS credentials

There are many ways to authenticate with your [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html).

:::tip
If you have the AWS CLI installed (which is not required in order to use the Defang CLI), you can verify that you've authenticated to AWS by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` and see your account ID.
:::

Once you’ve set up your `AWS_PROFILE` or retrieved your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION`, you’re ready to continue. Open your chat window and type /defang.AWS_Setup, or select the corresponding prompt from your IDE’s options.

![Trigger Prompt](/img/prompts/aws-prompt.png)

The [MCP prompt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) accepts two types of credentials:

1. Method 1 - Using an AWS Profile:
   The following prompt will have three arguments and only the first argument is required:

   - AWS Credential - REQUIRED : The name of the AWS profile you want to use (e.g., "default" or "my-profile"). ![AWS Profile argument](/img/prompts/aws-profile-arg.png)
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - IGNORE : Leave this argument blank and press Enter. ![Ignore AWS Secret Access Key argument](/img/prompts/aws-ignore_secret.png)
   - AWS_REGION - OPTIONAL : The AWS region where you want to deploy your services (e.g., "us-west-2"). ![AWS Region argument Optional](/img/prompts/aws-optional-region.png)

2. Method 2 - Using Access Keys:
   The following prompt will have three arguments and all three arguments are required:

   - AWS Credential - REQUIRED : The AWS Access Key ID (e.g., "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"). ![AWS Access Key ID argument](/img/prompts/aws-access-key-arg.png)
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - REQUIRED : The AWS Secret Access Key. (e.g., "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPExampleSecretKey").![AWS Secret Access Key argument](/img/prompts/aws-secret-key-arg.png)
   - AWS_REGION - REQUIRED : The AWS region where you want to deploy your services (e.g., "us-west-2"). ![AWS Region argument](/img/prompts/require-aws-region-arg.png)

### Step 3 - Deploy

Once the prompt completes without errors, your chat input will be automatically populated with the deployment command for the IDE to execute.

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

You can check the status of your deployment by using the [Defang Services tool](../concepts/mcp#services) or you can inspect the resources created in your AWS Dashboard.
