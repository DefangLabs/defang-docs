# Deploy to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This tutorial will show you how to deploy your services to your own AWS account using Defang with the CLI or MCP.

## Pre-requisites
* [A Dockerfile in your project](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)
* [A `compose.yaml` file in your project](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
* [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
* [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
* [AWS Account Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)

:::warning["MCP Pre-requisite"]
If you would like to deploy using [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you like need to setup the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) with the IDE of your choice.
:::

## CLI

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory
Head to the folder where your project is located.
```bash
$ cd path/to/your/project
```

### Step 2 - Authenticate Defang to use your AWS Account

There are many ways to authenticate your [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html).
Once you've done that, Defang will look for your AWS credentials in your shell environment and expect to find one of the following credential sets:
* the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable
* or, the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` environment variables

:::tip
If you have the AWS CLI installed (which is not required in order to use the Defang CLI), you can verify that you've authenticated to AWS by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` and see your account ID.
:::

### Step 3 - Deploy

Invoke the `defang compose up` CLI command with the `--provider=aws` flag or set the `DEFANG_PROVIDER=aws` environment variable.

For example:

```bash
$ defang compose up --provider=aws
```

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment

Defang will provision resources in your AWS account and deploy your services. You can inspect the resources created in your AWS Dashboard.

## MCP

### Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory with your IDE
Navigate to your project directory and open it in an IDE that has the [Defang MCP Server](../concepts/mcp.md) installed.

:::tip
If the Defang MCP server doesn’t start automatically, try starting or restarting it from your IDE settings.

:::

### Step 2 - Setting your provider
In your chat window, type `/mcp.defang.AWS_Setup`  or select the corresponding prompt from your IDE’s options.

![Trigger Prompt](/img/prompts/aws-prompt.png)

The [MCP prompt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) accepts two types of credentials:
* the AWS Profile arguement (skip the rest of the prompts after entering the AWS Profile)
* or, the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_REGION arguments

### Step 3 - Deploy
Once the prompt completes without errors, your chat input will be automatically populated with the deployment command for the LLM to execute.

### Step 4 - Inspect your deployment
You can check the status of your depolyment by using the [Defang Services tool](../concepts/mcp#services) or you can inspect the resources created in your AWS Dashboard.
