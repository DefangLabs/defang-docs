# Deploy Using Pulumi

:::warning
At the time of writing, the Defang Pulumi Provider only works with [Defang Playground](../concepts/defang-playground.md). We are working on [BYOC](../concepts/defang-byoc.md) support.
:::

This tutorial will show you how to deploy Minio with Pulumi using the Defang Provider.

## Pre-requisites

* [A Defang Account](/docs/concepts/authentication)
* [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install)
* [The Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli)
* [The Defang Pulumi Provider](/docs/concepts/pulumi#install-the-defang-pulumi-provider)

## Step 1 - Authenticate With Defang

Make sure you are logged into the [Defang CLI](/docs/concepts/authentication.md). Don't worry about the Pulumi CLI for now.

## Step 2 - Configure the Pulumi Backend

Navigate to your project directly. (If you don't have a project yet, try one of our [samples](https://defang.io/#samples))


Pulumi uses the `pulumi login` command to select a backend. In this tutorial, we will use the Local Filesystem backend for simplicity. When you are ready to deploy to production, you will probably want to look into other [Pulumi backend options](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends).

Run the following command to "login" to the filesystem backend in the local directory.

```bash
pulumi login file://./
```

This will make the Pulumi CLI store the state of your infrastructure in the current directory.

## Step 3 - Initialize the Pulumi Project

Run the following command to set your encryption passphrase for this terminal session:

```bash
export PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE="super-secure-passphrase"
```

Now let's initialize the Pulumi project:

```bash
pulumi new typescript -y --force
```

This will create a new Pulumi project in the current directory and will create a Pulumi stack called `dev` by default. We use the `--force` flag because the directory isn't empty (we created a folder when we logged in with the Pulumi CLI).

Run the following command to add to the `.gitignore` file:

```bash
echo ".pulumi" >> .gitignore
```

## Step 4 - Write Your Pulumi Code

Create an `index.ts` file to contain your Pulumi code. This code will describe our services, our service's dependencies, and our service's configuration.

```typescript
import * as defang from '@defang-io/pulumi-defang/lib';

export const service = new defang.DefangService('minio', {
    name: 'minio',
    image: 'quay.io/minio/minio',
    // starts the server with the console address set to :9001
    command: ['server', '--console-address', ':9001', '/data'],
    // Set the root username
    environment: {
        MINIO_ROOT_USER: 'minio',
    },
    secrets: [
        // Set the root password as a secret which will be encrypted at rest
        {
            source: 'MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD',
            value: 'minio123',
        },
    ],
    // Run a healthcheck every 30 seconds
    healthcheck: {
        test: ['CMD', 'curl', 'http://localhost:9000/minio/health/live'],
        interval: 30,
        timeout: 5,
        retries: 3,
    },
    // Expose the server on port 9000 and the console on port 9001
    ports: [
        {
            target: 9000,
            protocol: 'http',
            mode: 'ingress',
        },
        {
            target: 9001,
            protocol: 'http',
            mode: 'ingress',
        },
    ],
});
```

## Step 5 - Deploy to Defang

Now we're ready to deploy to Defang with Pulumi! Run the following command to deploy your service:

```bash
pulumi up --stack=dev
```

## Step 6 - Monitor the Deployment

You can monitor the deployment by running the following command:

```bash
defang tail --name minio
```

### Logging Into Minio

The [Defang Playground](../concepts/defang-playground.md) will give you a domain, which you can obtain by running the following command:

```bash
defang ls | grep 'minio.*9001'
```

If you navigate to the domain in your browser, you will be prompted to log in. Use the username `minio` and the password `minio123`.

### Clean Up

To clean up the deployment, run the following command:

```bash
pulumi destroy --stack=dev
```
