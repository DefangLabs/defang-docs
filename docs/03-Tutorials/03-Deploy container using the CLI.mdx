# Deploy container using the CLI

This example is useful if you already have a Docker container built manually or through a CI/CD system and have that the resulting image is available in a public or private repository accessible by Defang.

# Step 1 - Docker Compose
If you already have a Docker Compose file for your service(s) you can use it directly. Else you can create one like this:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  service1:
    # This is just an example, replace with the image you want
    image: "docker.io/nginx:latest"
    ports:
      - mode: ingress
        target: 3000		
```

# Step 2 - Deploy
```text
defang compose up --tail
```
