# Deploy code using the CLI

This tutorial assumes that the code normally gets built into a container and has a Dockerfile file in the current folder.

# Step 1 - Docker Compose
If you already have a Docker Compose file for your service(s) you can use it directly. Else you can create one like this:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  service1:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - mode: ingress
        target: 3000		
```

# Step 2 - Deploy
```text
defang compose up --tail
```
