# Cloud Providers

To the extent possible, Defang provisions resources that are native to the cloud provider you are using.

For the moment, Defang is only available in our hosted beta for non-production workloads running on AWS. Services are deployed to AWS ECS and are exposed to the internet using AWS Application Load Balancers.

:::info
The aim for Defang V1 is that you should run it on your own cloud account. We plan to support a variety of cloud providers, starting with AWS.
