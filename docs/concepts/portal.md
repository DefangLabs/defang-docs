# Portal

You can log into the Defang portal at [portal.defang.dev](https://portal.defang.dev) using your [Defang account](./accounts.md) to view the state of your Defang services running in the Defang Playground for non-production applications.

You can use the portal to get an overview of your services, view the logs for each service, quickly access exposed ports, view environment variables, and more.

:::info
We will make sure you have access to the tools required to debug your services in production. At the moment we're not entirely sure what that will look like, beyond `defang tail` to view logs, but we're working on it!
