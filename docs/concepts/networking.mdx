# Networking

By default, Defang configures your application's networking and security groups to follow secure best practices.
We also configure load-balancers and public IP addresses when appropriate. The following sections describe how to configure different network and security group topologies.

:::tip
This page is about complex networking. If you want to configure your services to be accessible from the public internet, check the [Domains page](./domains.mdx).

## Networks

The Compose spec has a notion of [networks](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/06-networks.md). By default, each service gets added to the `default` network.
Services in the `default` network can have public IPs. Services in any other network will be in a private subnet.
These services cannot be reached from outside the network, but they can still make network requests to the public internet.

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./fe
    ports:
      - 80 # load-balanced, ie. mode: ingress
    networks:
      default:
      private:

  backend:
    build: ./be
    ports:
      - mode: host # no load balancer
        target: 8080
    networks:
      private:

networks:
  default:
  private:
    internal: true # no egress
```

### Public Services

By default, services will be in the `default` network. By default these services are not accessible directly, but may be accessed through a public load-balancer, ie. exposed ports default to `mode: ingress`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    networks:
      default: # this is the default, so no need to specify
    ports:
      - 80:80 # Defang will use a public load-Balancer
```

If you want a service to have a public IP address, ensure it's in the `default` network (the default) and
set the port to `mode: host`:

```yaml
services;
  web:
    ports:
      - target: 80
        mode: host # Defang will assign a public IP
```

### Private Services
If you want a service with exposed ports to not be accessible from the public internet, create a private network:

```yaml
services:
  web: # this service can receive public traffic and communicate to private services
    ports:
      - 80
    networks:
      default:
      private:
  db: # this service can only receive traffic from other services in the same network
    ports:
      - 1234
    networks:
      private:
networks:
  private: # any network that's not "default" is considered private
```

The service's hostname will be the same as the service's name, in this case `db`.

## Hostname Aliases

By using network aliases, a service can be made available at multiple hostnames.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    domainname: example.com
    networks:
      default:
        aliases:
          - www.example.com # a public alias
```

### Internal DNS

Internal communication is handled slightly differently between the Defang Playground and Defang BYOC.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="playground" label="Playground" default>
Internal communication between services in the Defang Playground follows the following pattern:

```
http://<username>-<service-name>:<port>
```

The Defang CLI applies the `<username>` prefix when it detects service names in the values of environment variables.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="byoc" label="BYOC">
Internal communication between services in Defang BYOC follows the following pattern:

```
http://<service-name>:<port>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
