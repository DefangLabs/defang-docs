# Networking

Defang configures Security Groups, deploys applications to a private subnet and uses an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to your services from the public internet only when required.

:::tip
This page is about internal networking only. If you want to configure your services to be accessible from the public internet, check the [domains page](./domains.mdx).

## Internal Communication

You can expose ports in your service definition to allow other services to communicate with it. Similar to public communication, you can use the `ports` section of your service definition, but set the `mode` to `host` instead of `ingress` to allow other services to communicate with it through the internal network.

### Sample Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compose" label="Compose" default>
```yaml
services:
    # [...]
    service1:
        ports:
        - mode: host
          target: 3000	
          protocol: http
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pulumi" label="Pulumi">
```typescript
const service = new defang.DefangService("service1", {
    // [...]
    ports: [{
        target: 3000,
        mode: "host",
        protocol: "http",
    }],
});
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Internal DNS

Internal communication is handled slightly differently between the Defang Playground and Defang BYOC.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="playground" label="Playground" default>
Internal communication between services in the Defang Playground follows the following pattern:

```
http://<username>-<service-name>:<port>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="byoc" label="BYOC">
Internal communication between services in Defang BYOC follows the following pattern:
  
```
http://<service-name>:<port>
```
  </TabItem>
