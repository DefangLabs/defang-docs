# Networking

Defang configures Security Groups, deploys applications to a private subnet and uses an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to your services from the public internet only when required.

## Public Communication

To make your service accessible from the public internet, you can expose ports in your service definition. In a [`compose.yaml`](./compose.md) file, you can use the `ports` section of your service definition. In a [Pulumi program](./pulumi.md), you can use the `ports` property of your service definition.

```yaml
services:
    # [...]
    serviceName:
        ports:
        - mode: ingress
          target: 3000	
          protocol: http
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pulumi" label="Pulumi">
```typescript
const service = new defang.DefangService("serviceName", {
    // [...]
    ports: [{
        target: 3000,
        mode: "ingress",
        protocol: "http",
    }],
});
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Internal Communication

Internal communication between services is done using a combination of the username and service name. For example, if you are logged in as `developer1` have services called `service1` and `service2` and `service1` has port `3000` exposed, you can communicate with `service1` from `service2`  using `http://developer1-service1`.

    # [...]
    service1:
        ports:
        - mode: host
          target: 3000	
          protocol: http
```

        protocol: "http",
    }],
});
