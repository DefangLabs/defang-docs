# Networking

Defang configures Security Groups, deploys applications to a private subnet and uses an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to your services from the public internet only when required.

:::tip
This page is about internal networking only. If you want to configure your services to be accessible from the public internet, check the [Domains page](./domains.mdx).

## Internal Communication

You can expose ports in your service definition to allow other services to communicate with it. Similar to public communication, you can use the `ports` section of your service definition. Set the `mode` to `host` (instead of the default `ingress`) to be able to connect to the container directly, avoiding the need of a load balancer.

### Sample Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compose" label="Compose" default>
```yaml
services:
    # [...]
    service1:
      ports:
        - mode: host
          target: 3000	
          app_protocol: http
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pulumi" label="Pulumi">
```typescript
const service = new defang.DefangService("service1", {
    // [...]
    ports: [{
        target: 3000,
        mode: "host",
        protocol: "http",
    }],
});
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Internal DNS

Internal communication is handled slightly differently between the Defang Playground and Defang BYOC.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="playground" label="Playground" default>
Internal communication between services in the Defang Playground follows the following pattern:

```
http://<username>-<service-name>:<port>
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="byoc" label="BYOC">
Internal communication between services in Defang BYOC follows the following pattern:
  
```
http://<service-name>:<port>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Networks

The Compose spec has a notion of [networks](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/06-networks.md). By default, each service gets added to the `default` network. Networks in Compose can be flagged as `internal`, but this means they have no connection to the outside world at all (no egress). 

Only services in the `default` network can have public IPs. Services in any other network will be in a private subnet. 

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./fe
    ports:
      - 80 # load-balanced, ie. mode: ingress
    networks:
      default:
      private:

  backend:
    build: ./be
    ports:
      - mode: host # no load balancer
        target: 8080
    networks:
      private:

networks:
  default:
  private:
    internal: true # no egress
```
