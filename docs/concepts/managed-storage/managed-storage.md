# Managed Storage

Defang helps you provision the infrastructure you need to run your services. That infrastructure is designed to scale in and out without persistent storage, so you can build highly scalable services. But Defang can also help you provision managed services to store and persist your data, like [caches](./managed-redis.md), [databases](./managed-postgres.mdx), and [object storage](./managed-object-storage.md).
