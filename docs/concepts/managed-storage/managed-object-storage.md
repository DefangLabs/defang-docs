# Managed Object Storage

:::info Not Yet Supported
As of September 2024, Defang does not yet support managed Object Storage, but it is on our roadmap. If you are interested in Object Storage support, please vote on [this issue](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang/issues/688).
:::

Managed Object Storage, like AWS S3, is a service that allows you to store and retrieve large amounts of data. Object storage is ideal for storing unstructured data like images, videos, and backups.
