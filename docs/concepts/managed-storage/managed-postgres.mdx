# Managed Postgres

Postgres, or PostgreSQL, is a powerful open-source relational database system known for its robustness, extensibility, and compliance with SQL standards, making it ideal for complex applications requiring reliable data integrity and advanced querying. Defang can help you provision a managed Postgres instance.

## Current Support

| Provider | Managed Postgres |
| --- | --- |
| [Playground](/docs/providers/playground#managed-services) | ⚠️ Unmanaged |
| [AWS](/docs/providers/aws#managed-storage) | ✅ RDS Postgres |
| [DigitalOcean](/docs/providers/digitalocean#future-improvements) | ⚠️ Unmanaged |
| [GCP](/docs/providers/gcp#managed-storage) | ✅ Cloud SQL Postgres |

## How to use Managed Postgres

To use managed Postgres, in your `compose.yaml` file, use the `x-defang-postgres` extension to define your Postgres service. Adding the extension will tell Defang to provision a managed instance, rather than running Postgres as a service.

### Required Configuration

When using managed Postgres, you **must** set a password for the database using `defang config set POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. If you do not provide the password, the deployment will fail.

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: You can can assign the password in the service's environment variables. To learn more about how this works, read about [configuration](../configuration.md).

### Optional Configuration

You can also set the following optional environment variables to configure the managed Postgres instance:

- `POSTGRES_USER`: The user for the managed Postgres instance. The default is `postgres`.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name for the managed Postgres instance. The default is `postgres`.

### Connecting to Managed Postgres

You can connect to the managed Postgres instance using the name of your service as the hostname, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variables.

### Example

:::info
For a smoother experience with Defang, we recommend using Postgres 14 for your container images. This version provides easier access and improved usability.
:::

```yaml
  app:
    # [...]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_HOST: database
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
      // highlight-start
      # Note: by leaving the value empty, Defang will use the
      # value set using `defang config set POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD:
      // highlight-end
      # Note: you can create a connection string by using interpolation,
      # reference config variables by using ${<config name>}
      CONNECTURL: postgresql://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@database:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
  database:
    image: postgres:14
    x-defang-postgres: true
    ports:
      - mode: host
        target: 5432
    environment:
      // highlight-start
      # Note: by leaving the value empty, Defang will use the
      # value set using `defang config set POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD:
      // highlight-end

```

## Final Snapshots

When a project is deployed to a [production environment](/docs/concepts/deployment-modes), any managed Postgres instances are automatically configured to create a snapshot of the database before deletion. The snapshot will be named with the following format:

`
<project-name>-<service>-postgres-<id>-final-snapshot
`

The AWS Console can be used to restore a snapshot into a new instance of Postgres. This feature is not yet supported in GCP.

### Major Version Updating of Engine

To update the database engine you can update the image to a later version in your Compose file and apply it via ```defang compose up --provider=aws```. In the example below, we change from Postgres 15 to 16.

Please note the upgrading will occur immediately and may result in the database being unavailable for some time.

```
database:
  image: postgres:15
```

to

```
database:
  image: postgres:16
```
