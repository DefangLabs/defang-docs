# Defang Playground

Defang aims to make it easier to deploy your services to the cloud. Specifically, Defang's goal is to make it easier to deploy your workloads to your *own* cloud accounts. We refer to this as bring-your-own-cloud (BYOC) which you can read about in more depth [here](./defang-byoc). We also provide Defang Playground, but it is only intended for non-production workloads so you can get a feel for how Defang works.

Defang Playground is a free tier that allows you to deploy services to a Defang-hosted cloud account without needing to manage your own. It is intended for non-production workloads only. The Playground is a great way to get started with Defang. You can even use [1-Click Deploy](/docs/tutorials/using-one-click-deploy) to try it out quickly or you can get started with the [Defang CLI](/docs/getting-started).

:::warning
Please note that the Defang Playground is intended for testing/learning purposes only. The environment may be reset at any time. Do not run production workloads in Defang Playground.

:::info
The Playground allows only 1 deployed project at a time. Use the CLI `defang down` command to tear down a project before deploying a new one.

## Overview

Overall, the Defang Playground is very similar to deploying to your own cloud account. The Playground runs on a Defang-managed AWS account, so you can expect it to work similarly to deploying to [AWS](../providers/aws/aws.md).

This page highlights architectural considerations when deploying to the Playground and any differences you might encounter when deploying to the Playground versus deploying to your own cloud account.

## Limitations

There are a few limitations to Defang Playground. These limitations are in place to ensure that Defang Playground is only used for non-production workloads. If you are interested in running production workloads, you should use Defang BYOC.

### No Apex Domain Support

When you deploy a service to Defang Playground, it will be assigned a domain under the `defang.dev` domain. We do not support pointing your own apex domains to Defang Playground services, but you can use subdomains.

### Max Resources

* Projects: 1
* Services: 4
* CPUs: 2
* Memory: 1GiB
* Replicas: 1

### Managed services

In essence, the Playground does not support any [managed storage](./managed-storage) services, ie. `x-defang-postgres` and `x-defang-redis` are ignored when deploying to the Playground. You can however run both Postgres and Redis as regular container services for testing purposes.

### Managed LLMs

Defang offers integration with managed, cloud-native large language model services with the `x-defang-llm` service extension when deploying to your own cloud account with BYOC. This extension is supported in the Defang Playground with one caveat: your MODEL (model ID) will be limited to a default model chosen by Defang.
