# Domains

Defang helps you provision SSL certificates and expose your services to the internet. You can expose your services using Defang-hosted domains or bring your own custom domain with [Defang BYOC](./defang-byoc.md). This page explains how to configure your services to be accessible from the public internet. 

## Defang-hosted Domains

To make your service accessible from the public internet with Defang-hosted domains (under `defang.app`), you simply expose ports in your service definition. 

### Structure

Defang-hosted domains use a structure that is based on your username and service name. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="playground" label="Playground" default>
If you have a publicly accessible service, you will automatically receive a domain to access it. If you're deploying to the [Defang Playground](./defang-playground.md), your domain will be structured as follows:

```
https://<username>-<service-name>--<port>.defang.dev
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="byoc" label="BYOC">
If you're using [Defang BYOC](./defang-byoc.md), your domain will be:

```
https://<service-name>--<port>.username.defang.app
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Sample Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compose" label="Compose" default>
```yaml
services:
    # [...]
    serviceName:
        ports:
        // highlight-start
        - mode: ingress
          target: 3000	
          protocol: http
        // highlight-end
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pulumi" label="Pulumi">
:::warning
As of now, the Pulumi provider does not support [Defang BYOC](./defang-byoc.md).
:::
```typescript
const service = new defang.DefangService("serviceName", {
    // [...]
    ports: [{
        target: 3000,
        mode: "ingress",
        protocol: "http",
    }],
});
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Bring Your Own Domain

You can also bring your own domain to a Defang project. This allows you to use your own domain name to access your services, and varies a little bit depending on your setup.

### BYOC or Defang Playground

If you are using [Defang BYOC](./defang-byoc.md) and *do not* have your domain's DNS hosted with your cloud provider, or if you are using the [Defang Playground](./defang-playground.md), you will need to follow this flow:

1. Add the `domainname` to your service definition.
2. Run `defang compose up` to deploy your project.
3. Run `defang cert generate` to generate an SSL certificate. This command will provide instructions for where to point your domain's DNS before the certificate can be issued.

### BYOC

If you are using [Defang BYOC](./defang-byoc.md) *and the DNS for your domain is hosted with your cloud provider* (i.e. a Hosted Zone in Route 53, if you're using AWS), all you need to do is specify the `domainname` in your service definition, as in the example below.

:::warning
For the time being, you can only use one domain per service.
If you need to use multiple domains, please vote on this [issue](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang/issues/247).

### Sample Configuration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compose" label="Compose" default>
```yaml
services:
    # [...]
    serviceName:
        // highlight-next-line
        domainname: example.com
        ports:
        // highlight-start
        - mode: ingress
          target: 3000	
          protocol: http
        // highlight-end
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pulumi" label="Pulumi">
:::warning
As of now, the Pulumi provider does not support [Defang BYOC](./defang-byoc.md) and the [Defang Playground](./defang-playground.md) does not support bringing your own domain, since it is not for production use.
