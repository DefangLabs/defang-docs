    "description": "Defang allows you to use your own cloud accounts to deploy your applications. Click on a link below to read documentation about specific providers. If no provider is specified, the Defang CLI will prompt you to select a provider interactively. The selected provider will be stored in the working directory of the projectâ€™s compose file and will be applied to all subsequent commands by default. You can also specify a preferred provider in the compose file by using `x-defang-provider` extension at the root level of the compose file."
