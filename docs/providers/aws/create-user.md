## Creating an AWS IAM User for Defang

To deploy applications with Defang on AWS, you need an IAM user with appropriate permissions and access keys. This guide walks you through the process step by step.

## Step 1: Create an IAM User

### a. Open the IAM Service
Go to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and open the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service. Under **Access Management**, select **Users**.
