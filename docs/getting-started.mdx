# Getting Started

## Install the Defang CLI

Defang doesn't require installing anything in your cloud, but you will need to install the [open source](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang) Defang command line interface (CLI) to interact with your Defang resources and account.

We offer a few different ways to install the Defang CLI. You can use a shell script, Homebrew, Winget, or you can download the binary directly.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="Shell">
    **Using a shell script**

    You can install the Defang CLI using a shell script. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    eval "$(curl -fsSL s.defang.io/install)"
    ```

    The script will try to download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture, add it to `~/.local/bin`, and add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` if it's not already there, with your permission. If you do not provide permission it will print an appropriate instruction for you to follow to add it manually. You can also customize the installation directory by setting the `INSTALL_DIR` environment variable before running the script.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew" default>
    **Using Homebrew**

    You can easily install the Defang CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    brew install DefangLabs/defang/defang
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="winget" label="Winget">
    **Using Winget**

    On Windows, you can install the Defang CLI using `winget`. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```powershell
    winget install defang
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nix" label="Nix">
    **Using Nix**

    ```bash
    nix profile install github:DefangLabs/defang#defang-bin --refresh
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="direct" label="Direct Download">
    **Direct Download**

    You can find the latest version of the Defang CLI on the [latest release page](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang/releases/latest). Just download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture, and put it somewhere in your `PATH`.

## Generate a project

```
$ defang generate nodejs-http
```

You should see the following prompt:
```
? What folder would you like to create the project in?
```
Type in the name of the folder you'd like to use for your new project and press ENTER.

I'll type `"welcome-to-defang"`. Now, you'll see the following output:

```
? What folder would you like to create the project in? welcome-to-defang
 * Fetching sample from the Defang repository...
 * Writing files to disk...
   - .github/
   - .github/workflows/
   - .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
   - README.md
   - app/
   - app/Dockerfile
   - app/main.js
   - compose.yaml
 * Code generated successfully in folder welcome-to-defang

Check the files in your favorite editor.
To deploy the service, do `cd welcome-to-defang` and

  defang compose up
```

Now, navigate to the folder you just created:

```
$ cd welcome-to-defang
```

You can open the folder in your favorite editor and see the files that were generated for you:
* The `app` folder contains the code for your service.
* The `Dockerfile` is used to build the container image for your service.
* The `compose.yaml` file is used to define the services you want to deploy.

## Deploy to the playground

Go back to your shell and type the following:

```
$ defang up
```

If you have not used Defang before, you'll be prompted to log in.

```
 ! Please log in to continue.
Please visit http://127.0.0.1:49154 and log in. (Right click the URL or press ENTER to open browser)
