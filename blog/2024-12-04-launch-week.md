## **What‚Äôs New in Defang CLI V1?**

**Defang is a powerful tool that lets you easily develop, deploy, and debug production-ready cloud applications**.

Defang is now [WAFR](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support-well-architected/)-compliant, assuring that your deployments conform to all the best-practices for AWS deployments. Defang is now officially part of the [AWS Partner Network](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/).
