Over the past few months, our team has been working tirelessly to create a tool that transforms how developers develop, deploy, and debug cloud apps. With Defang, you can go from idea to your favorite cloud in minutes. ðŸš€

Today, we have the opportunity to showcase Defang to a global audience, and your support could make all the difference!

If you already have a Product Hunt account, it's super easy.
* âœ…Â You can support our product if you like what we have built so far
* âœ… You can leave a comment and any feedback you may have (comments are great!)
* âœ… You can leave a review

Product Hunt launches are time sensitive as they last 24 hours, so if you have 30 seconds available right now, it would really mean a lot.

If you don't already have a Product Hunt account, please don't create one now to upvote (we may get penalized for that).

Instead, you can like and share our (e.g. LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook) posts
.
Thank you in advance. Your support means the world.
