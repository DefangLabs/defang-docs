## Deploying Agentic Apps to the Cloud Shouldn’t Be This Hard…

Agentic apps are redefining how software is built: multi-agent workflows, persistent memory, tool-using LLMs, and orchestrated autonomy. But deploying them to the cloud is still painful - for example, your agentic app typically needs to provision:

- Managed databases like Postgres or MongoDB
- Fast, scalable caching (hello Redis)
- Containerized compute that scales
- Secure networking and service discovery
- Managed LLMs like AWS Bedrock or GCP Vertex AI

And for many teams, these apps must run inside the customer’s cloud, where sensitive data lives and compliance rules apply. That means you cannot just spin up your own environment and call it a day. Instead, you are deploying across AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, or whichever stack your customers demand, each with its own APIs, quirks, and limitations.

Now you are not just building agents; you are picking the right infrastructure, rewriting IaC templates for every provider, and untangling the edge cases of each cloud.

The result: weeks of DevOps headaches, lost momentum, and engineers stuck wiring infrastructure instead of shipping agents.

## We Made it Simple with Cloud Native Support for Agentic Apps

That’s where Defang comes in. We make it easy to deploy full-stack agentic apps to your cloud of choice: native, secure, and scalable.
Defang understands the common ingredients of agentic apps and makes them first-class citizens:

- Compute: Your Dockerized services deploy as cloud-native workloads (e.g. AWS ECS, or GCP Cloud Run)
- Databases: Provision managed Postgres or MongoDB with one config line
- Caching: Add Redis and Defang spins up a managed Redis instance in your cloud
- LLMs: Integrate directly with Bedrock or Vertex AI - even provision an OpenAI gateway for compatibility with OpenAI APIs.
- Secure Defaults: : TLS, secrets, IAM, and service accounts handled out of the box

## Built for All your Favorite Agentic Frameworks

Defang works seamlessly with leading agentic frameworks. Try them out with our ready-to-deploy samples:

- [Autogen](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/tree/main/samples/agentic-autogen) - demo featuring Mistral AI + FastAPI, deployable with Defang’s OpenAI Access Gateway.
- [CrewAI](https://docs.defang.io/blog/2025/06/16/crew-ai-sample) - sample app showing multi-agent orchestration in action.
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/tree/main/samples/agentic-langgraph) - workflow sample that defines and controls multi-step agentic graphs with LangChain.
- [Agentic Strands](https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-agentic-strands-template/tree/main) - A Strands Agent application.

## Why It Matters

Agentic apps need to be fast, secure, and ready to scale. Defang delivers cloud-native deployments in your environment (AWS, GCP, DO), so you can move from idea to production quickly with consistent behavior across dev, test, and prod.

## The Developer Journey, Simplified

1. Build your agentic app locally using Docker Compose
2. Test in Defang's free playground with `defang compose up`
3. Deploy to your cloud:

```bash
defang compose up --provider=aws  # or gcp, digitalocean
```

It just works. No Terraform. No YAML explosion. No vendor lock-in.

## The Future of AI Apps Is Agentic and Cloud-Native

Agility and scalability should not be a trade-off. With Defang, you get both. Developers focus on agents, tools, and outcomes. Defang takes care of the cloud infrastructure.
