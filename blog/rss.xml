            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks! We've got another batch of updates to share with you about what the Defang team has been working on over the past month. We're committed to improving your deployment experience, so let's take a look at what's new.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="windows-experience-improvements">Windows Experience Improvements<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/july-2024-product-update#windows-experience-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Windows Experience Improvements" title="Direct link to Windows Experience Improvements">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>For our Windows users out there, we've made some changes to make your Defang experience even smoother:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now install Defang using <code>winget</code>, the Windows Package Manager, for a streamlined setup</li>
<li>We've introduced a signed binary for added security and peace of mind</li>
</ul>
<p>Deploying your apps from Windows just got a little bit nicer.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-click-deploy">One-click Deploy<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/july-2024-product-update#one-click-deploy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to One-click Deploy" title="Direct link to One-click Deploy">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We've added a new feature that will make it even easier to get started with Defang. We've created a flow where each sample provides a button that allows you to immediately deploy a template with a GitHub action which will automatically deploy the sample to the Defang Playground. That means you can easily make changes by committing them to your brand new repo, and everything automatically updates in the Playground. It's a great way to get started with Defang and start experimenting with your own projects.</p>
<p>Try it now <a href="https://portal.defang.dev/sample" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from our portal</a>!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of 1-click deploy UI in portal" src="https://docs.defang.io/assets/images/1-click-deploy-59a918debb5a9dcbcecd2c7b4dd3c26d.png" width="1200" height="744" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="managed-redis-updates">Managed Redis Updates<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/july-2024-product-update#managed-redis-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Managed Redis Updates" title="Direct link to Managed Redis Updates">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We first introduced this last month, but we've since rolled it out to everyone. We also added a sample that showcases the power of managed Redis: <a href="https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-bullmq-bullboard-redis-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BullMQ with Redis</a>. It demonstrates how you can use BullMQ and BullBoard with a managed Redis instance to create a powerful job queue system so you can easily build robust, scalable applications in AWS with Defang.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="updated-samples">Updated Samples<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/july-2024-product-update#updated-samples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Updated Samples" title="Direct link to Updated Samples">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We've updated our sample projects to showcase how to use them with Defang, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-csharp-dotnet-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET Core</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-feathersjs-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feathers.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-langchain-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask &amp; LangChain</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-bullmq-bullboard-redis-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BullMQ with Redis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check them out if you're looking for some inspiration or a starting point for your own projects.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cli-updates">CLI Updates<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/july-2024-product-update#cli-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CLI Updates" title="Direct link to CLI Updates">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We're always looking for ways to enhance the CLI experience. Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npx defang</code> automatically checks to always have the latest version of the CLI</li>
<li>The output during <code>defang compose up</code> has been streamlined to focus on the most important information</li>
<li><code>defang tail</code> now supports listening to specific services, making it easier to troubleshoot issues</li>
<li>We've improved hints and error messages to better guide you when something goes wrong</li>
<li>The CLI now has improved color support for light theme terminals, making it easier on the eyes</li>
</ul>
<p>It's the small refinements that can make a big difference in your workflow.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-updates">Other Updates<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/july-2024-product-update#other-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Updates" title="Direct link to Other Updates">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Here are a few more things that didn't quite fit with the rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visibility into ECS deployment events in BYOC tail logs</li>
<li>Improvements to ACME certificate generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep an eye out for these updates in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<p>As always, we'd love your help shaping the future of Defang, so let us know what you'd like to see next. Happy deploying! ðŸš€</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks! Weâ€™re back with another exciting update about Defang. Our team has been working hard to bring you new features and improvements so you can get deploying faster. Hereâ€™s a rundown of what weâ€™ve been up to this month:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="samples-samples-samples">Samples, samples, samples!<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#samples-samples-samples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Samples, samples, samples!" title="Direct link to Samples, samples, samples!">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We've been cranking out samples like there's no tomorrow. We've published samples to get you up and running with FastAPI, Elysia, Angular, React, Svelte, Sveltekit, Sails.js, Phoenix, and more. You can filter through them on the <a href="https://defang.io/#deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defang homepage</a>. Check out our video about all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIU_af-sX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new samples and functionality</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="start-from-a-sample-in-seconds">Start from a sample in seconds<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#start-from-a-sample-in-seconds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Start from a sample in seconds" title="Direct link to Start from a sample in seconds">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>With all this work we've been putting into samples, we realized it would be pretty awesome if you could clone a sample faster. So we updated the CLI. Now, if you run <code>defang generate</code> you'll be able to filter through the samples and choose one. You can also filter through the samples on the <a href="https://defang.io/#deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defang homepage</a> and clone any of them with a simple command like <code>defang new sveltekit</code>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sample-templates">Sample templates<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#sample-templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sample templates" title="Direct link to Sample templates">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>If you look through our <a href="https://github.com/DefangLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub organization</a>, you'll start seeing loads of repos with the structure <code>sample-&lt;sample_name&gt;-template</code>. If you open them, you can create a new repo by clicking this button:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang-docs/assets/910895/97d33d90-43b9-499a-b139-e114b701adcb" alt="screenshot of github UI pointing towards template button" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Not only will that create a new repo based on the sample in your account, but if you've used Defang before (and accepted the Terms and Conditions) it will automatically deploy it to the playground so you can start playing with Defang immediately.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="acme-for-byod">ACME for BYOD<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#acme-for-byod" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ACME for BYOD" title="Direct link to ACME for BYOD">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Weâ€™re excited to announce that ACME support is now available for Bring Your Own Domain (BYOD) in both Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) and Playground. This means you can easily add Let's Encrypt certificates to your custom domains, regardless of where your DNS is hosted. Defang will handle the certificate generation and automatic renewal for you. Nice and easy.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="warnings-for-stateful-services">Warnings for Stateful Services<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#warnings-for-stateful-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Warnings for Stateful Services" title="Direct link to Warnings for Stateful Services">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>To help you avoid potential pitfalls, weâ€™ve added warnings against deploying stateful services with Defang, since you shouldn't actually be deploying anything stateful with Defang. For example, we'll warn you if you try to deploy services with images like <code>postgres:&lt;version&gt;</code>, <code>redis:&lt;version&gt;</code>, <code>minio:&lt;version&gt;</code>, etc.</p>
<p>In the near future we will be offering ways to run some stateful services using cloud providers' managed offerings. For example Redis, Postgres, and S3. Speaking of which...</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="managed-redis">Managed Redis!<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#managed-redis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Managed Redis!" title="Direct link to Managed Redis!">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Redis is such a versatile tool that can help with so many different use cases. So we've introduced Managed Redis! You can now specify the Redis image in your <code>compose.yaml</code> file and indicate that you want it managed by your cloud provider using <code>x-defang-redis: true</code> in your service definition.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="load-testing">Load Testing<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#load-testing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Load Testing" title="Direct link to Load Testing">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>To make sure Defang is ready for loads of new users, we've been doing a lot of load testing. This is going to help us identify and address potential bottlenecks so we can make sure that Defang scales efficiently and handles all you new users smoothly.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upgraded-kaniko">Upgraded Kaniko<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#upgraded-kaniko" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upgraded Kaniko" title="Direct link to Upgraded Kaniko">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve upgraded our Kaniko integration to version 1.23.0 to improve your container build experience. The new version comes with several bug fixes that enhance stability and performance. This means faster and more reliable builds for your applications.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upcoming-features">Upcoming Features<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#upcoming-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upcoming Features" title="Direct link to Upcoming Features">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Weâ€™re not stopping here! Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at whatâ€™s coming soon:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="managed-postgres">Managed Postgres<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#managed-postgres" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Managed Postgres" title="Direct link to Managed Postgres">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Building on the momentum of Managed Redis, weâ€™re introducing Managed Postgres. Soon youâ€™ll be able to easily integrate a managed Postgres database into your deployment!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="byoc-ecs-lifecycle-events">BYOC ECS Lifecycle Events<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/june-2024-product-update#byoc-ecs-lifecycle-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BYOC ECS Lifecycle Events" title="Direct link to BYOC ECS Lifecycle Events">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Defang runs your services with ECS, and we're working on making it clearer what's happening under the hood.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates and improvements. As always, we appreciate your feedback and are committed to making Defang the easiest way to deploy your applications to the cloud. Go deploy something awesome! ðŸš€</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks! There is a lot going on at Defang and we're excited to share our latest product updates with you. Over the last month, we've been working hard to improve the Defang system and make it even easier for you to deploy your applications. Here's a quick overview of what we've been up to:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="npx-defang">npx defang<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/may-2024-product-update#npx-defang" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to npx defang" title="Direct link to npx defang">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We know a lot of you are using Defang for the first time. To make it easier to get started, we've added a new way to install the Defang CLI. Now you can use npx to run the CLI without installing it globally. Just run:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npx defang@latest</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This will download the latest version of the Defang CLI and run it for you. No need to worry about installing or updating the CLI manually!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coming-soon-bring-your-own-domain-with-lets-encrypt">(coming soon) Bring Your Own Domain with Let's Encrypt<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/may-2024-product-update#coming-soon-bring-your-own-domain-with-lets-encrypt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to (coming soon) Bring Your Own Domain with Let's Encrypt" title="Direct link to (coming soon) Bring Your Own Domain with Let's Encrypt">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Previously you could bring your own domain with <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc">Defang BYOC</a>... but you had to host the DNS records with AWS Route 53 in the AWS account you were deploying to. Now you can point domains hosted anywhere to your Defang deployment and we'll take care of the rest. We'll help generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for your domain and automatically renew it for you.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="windows-support">Windows Support<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/may-2024-product-update#windows-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Windows Support" title="Direct link to Windows Support">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Some of you use Defang from a Windows PC and previously a few features didn't work correctly on Windows. Some stuff we've fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>ansi color codes in logs</li>
<li>handle ctrl-c when tailing logs</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improved-cli">Improved CLI<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/may-2024-product-update#improved-cli" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Improved CLI" title="Direct link to Improved CLI">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>We've made a variety of small tweaks and improvements to the CLI which should make things a little bit cleaner and more stable.</p>
<ul>
<li>log messages have been made more clear</li>
<li>adding more progress information during compose up</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stability-and-reliability">Stability and Reliability<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/may-2024-product-update#stability-and-reliability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability and Reliability" title="Direct link to Stability and Reliability">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Defang is still in Beta and we know we've got to be rock solid by the time we release V1, so we've been working hard to improve the stability and reliability of the Defang architecture. We've been battle-testing different technologies to see how they hold up and have mad a few changes that should make things even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>capacity improvements in build queues</li>
<li>improvements in log availability</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks! Today, I'm going to share one of our code samples that will show you how to deploy a simple Slack bot. If you're looking to connect a cloud service to Slack to publish status updates, or something else like that, this should help you get started. We'll walk through a step-by-step process of writing a Go program using the <a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/github.com/slack-go/slack">github.com/slack-go/slack</a> library to interact with the Slack API and easily deploy it using Defang.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="https://docs.defang.io/blog/slackbot-sample#prerequisites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prerequisites" title="Direct link to Prerequisites">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Install Defang CLI:</strong> Simplify your deployment process by installing the Defang CLI tool. Follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/getting-started/installing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to get it up and running quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slack API Token:</strong> Create a Slack App at <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.slack.com/apps</a>, granting it the necessary permissions, including the&nbsp;bot <code>chat:write</code>&nbsp;scope.
<img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the bot scopes" src="https://docs.defang.io/assets/images/scopes-fb7d3e9b342204a7ff3e831b79b684c6.png" width="1420" height="588" class="img_ev3q"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install the app in your workspace:</strong> You'll need to install the app in your workspace for it to work. Click the "Install to Workspace" button in the Slack admin UI to do this. Mine says "Reinstall" because I've already installed it.
<img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the install button" src="https://docs.defang.io/assets/images/install-app-8fa3aa70b101a64027fae596b2d5b1ad.png" width="1432" height="1222" class="img_ev3q"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token:</strong> This token will authenticate your Slackbot with the Slack API.
<img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the auth token field" src="https://docs.defang.io/assets/images/token-d9b368f00c44bfb3705fe299988a344e.png" width="1934" height="1428" class="img_ev3q"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invite the Bot to a Channel:</strong> To enable your Slackbot, invite it to the desired channel using the&nbsp;<code>@&lt;botname&gt;</code>&nbsp;command. In the screenshot below, my bot's name actually starts with the word invite, but if your bot is called <code>mycoolbot</code> you would invite it with <code>@mycoolbot</code>. This ensures your Slackbot has the required permissions to interact with the channel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Defang is aiming to reduce the barriers to entry to cloud application development. With our tooling, we make it really easy to deploy multi-service containerized applications <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to your own cloud</a> with a single command.</p>
<p>We want it to be easy for you to try Defang with as little friction as possible, though, so we have done the work so you can easily get started in a GitHub Codespaces environment, a GitPod Workspace, or even a local Dev Container.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div align="center"><em>About the author: Aaron Yu is currently an intern at Defang Software Labs with a keen interest in the area of web development. He wrote this blog post after trying to deploy an application by himself directly on AWS first, and then using Defang.</em></div>
<br>
<p>As a student at University of British Columbia, new to the area of web development, I needed to develop and deploy a web application as a course project. It was already a huge challenge to complete the coding part. I could not believe that an even bigger challenge awaited. Picking the right platform and services is tough to start with. Do you know that AWS offers 200 different services? Lucky for me my professorsâ€™ instructed us to use ECS. Otherwise, I would have been totally lost.</p>
<p>Starting my project, honestly, it felt like I was hitting a brick wall. Diving into AWS with little to no clue was tough. Terms like "ECS clusters," "task definitions," and "IAM roles" were flying over my head. I was scared of messing something up, especially when it came to setting up things like ECR and load balancers.</p>
<p>It was overwhelming when all these unfamiliar concepts came at me at once. I searched them up on the internet and went straight to a top-rated YouTube tutorial. I spent an hour and a half going through the whole video series. Those tutorials, as helpful as they were, couldn't fully prepare me for the hands-on challenges of real-life implementation. It's one thing to follow along with a guide when everything goes right; it's another to adapt when things don't quite match up to the tutorialâ€™s scenarios.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://docs.defang.io/img/how-AWS-looks.png" alt="Example banner" width="550px"></div>
<div align="center"><em>It could be confusing if you are new to this area</em></div>
<br>
<p>I ran into so many problems with configuring services. Sometimes it is caused by carelessly selecting the wrong options; sometimes it is due to the fact that I have no idea what the buttons mean; sometimes it is just a bug with my code. Those errors triple the time it took to deploy my project. It was indeed extremely frustrating.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://docs.defang.io/img/error-AWS.png" alt="error-AWS" width="550px"></div>
<div align="center"><em>I have this scary screen when trying to delete the service I created; this is merely one of the many errors I faced</em></div>
<br>
<p>Then I found Defang (<a href="http://www.defang.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.defang.io</a>), and it was like someone flipped a switch. Suddenly, all that complicated stuff became way easier. All I needed to do is to install Defang, build a compose.yaml file to describe my application, and run a single command - defang compose up. And Defang even has a Gen-AI assistant to help you write the code and compose file for your application. Defang automatically does all the heavy-lifting behind the scenes - configuring all the necessary services in a secure and optimal way, and automatically building and deploying my application components. No more late nights trying to figure out AWS docs or stressing about getting everything right. Deploying my Django Restaurant Homepage went from being my biggest worry to one of the smoothest parts of my project.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://docs.defang.io/img/defang-compose-up.png" alt="defang-compose-up" width="550px"></div>
<div align="center"><em>with just a single command in the CLI</em></div>
<br>
<p>With Defang, I could chill a bit and actually enjoy working on my project, focusing on the cool parts without getting bogged down by all the technical stuff. It made cloud deployment feel doable and fun, even for someone like me who was pretty much a beginner. Give it a try yourself - go to <a href="http://www.defang.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.defang.io</a> to get started.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://docs.defang.io/img/sample-result.png" alt="sample-result" width="550px"></div>
<div align="center"><em>It is deployed to the internet! (arorschach is my username)</em></div>
<br>
<p>Try it yourself!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Announcing the Defang Public Beta</strong></p>
<p><strong>A radically simpler way for developers to create, deploy, and manage cloud applications.</strong></p>
<p>Ever since we shipped our Private Beta in the summer of 2023, we have been working with early adopters and listening to their feedback. While these early customers loved the ease with which they could create, deploy, and manage a cloud application, they had one big request - to deploy their applications to their own cloud (e.g. AWS) account. This was important to them for a number of reasons - to leverage their cloud credits, to enforce their IAM roles and security settings, to integrate new application components with their existing deployments, and more.</p>
<p>And so, today with our Public Beta, we are addressing this request. With todayâ€™s release of <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defang BYOC</a> (Bring-your-own-Cloud), you can now enjoy all the benefits of Defang <strong>and</strong> deploy applications to your own AWS account! Our Private Beta experience is still available as <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-playground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defang Playground</a> for you to quickly and easily prototype applications and deploy them to our hosted environment.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Defang <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Also check out our <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/category/tutorials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorials</a>, <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/samples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">samples</a>, and <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> to know more.</p>
<p><strong>Try the Public Beta!</strong></p>
<p>To try the Public Beta, please go to <a href="http://defang.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defang.io</a> and click on <a href="https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a> to download the CLI and <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Announcing the Private Beta for the Defang Opinionated Platform: Radically Simplifying and Cloud Application Development, Deployment, and Optimization</strong></p>
<p>We're thrilled to announce the release of our Private Beta for the Defang Opinionated Platform (DOP). We started Defang because, as practitioners with experience in both building cloud apps and building cloud platforms, we were unhappy with the state of the art. It was, and remains, too difficult to develop, deploy, and optimize cloud applications. In architecting and building a cloud app, developers need to consider a variety of factors such as performance, scalability, cost, security, flexibility, simplicity, etc. At the same time, they face a bewildering array of choices - from app architecture to choice of cloud platforms and services, to configuration and deployment, CI-CD, security setting, etc. - in topics that they are not experts in. Clearly, we need a better way.</p>
<p>We realize that improving on this state of affairs is a long journey. Today, we are taking an initial step with the release of the Private Beta of the DOP. The DOP enables <strong>AI-assisted development</strong>, with the ability to specify a high-level prompt and get back an initial version of your cloud service code, which can then be refined further. The DOP <strong>simplifies CI-CD</strong> by automatically building and deploying new artifacts to your target environments when you push new code to your source repository, taking care of all dependency management and build tasks. And the <strong>DOP pre-provisions properly secured and configured staging and production environments</strong> for your application, optimized for security, scaling, and cost.</p>
<p><strong>Try the Private Beta!</strong></p>
<p>To try the Private Beta, please go to <a href="https://portal.defang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portal.defang.dev</a> and register. We would love to have you kick the tires and give us your feedback! You can also check out our <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>, <a href="https://docs.defang.io/docs/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">samples</a>, and our <a href="https://github.com/DefangLabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Tuned for More</strong></p>
<p>While the Private Beta is a start, we have already heard requests for additional features from some of our early adopters and have a lot more in the pipeline! Top of the list is the ability to bring your own cloud accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP). Another frequent request is the ability to access a variety of compute and storage services native to the underlying platform while still maintaining app portability. And we also hear about the need to be able to monitor and optimize an app once deployed. We are already working on all these items and hope to have more to share in the coming months - stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded>
