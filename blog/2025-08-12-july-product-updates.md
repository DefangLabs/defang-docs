![Defang Compose Update](/img/defang-compose-update.webp)

July was all about making cloud deployments even smoother and smarter. We focused on removing friction from deployments and giving you better visibility into costs. Railpack now builds production-ready images automatically when no Dockerfile is present, and our real-time cost estimation feature now supports Google Cloud alongside AWS. We also added managed MongoDB on GCP, introduced an Agentic LangGraph sample, and connected with builders at Bière & Code & Beer MTL. Here’s what’s new.

## Railpack Integration

We’ve integrated [Railpack](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/railpack) into Defang to make deployments even smoother. Railpack automatically builds OCI-compliant images from your source code with minimal configuration. This helps eliminate one of the most common issues our users face: missing or invalid Dockerfiles, especially when they’re generated by LLMs or created by users with limited Docker experience. Now, if no Dockerfile is provided, Defang will seamlessly use Railpack to build a working image for you, so you can focus on your code, not your container setup.

## GCP Cost Estimation

In June, Defang announced real-time cost estimation for AWS. In July, we took our [live cloud cost estimation](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/estimation) to the next level by extending support to GCP. Defang now makes it easy to compare real-time pricing for both cloud providers. All you need is your project's compose.yaml file. Whether you’re optimizing for cost, performance, or flexibility, Defang makes it easy to get the information you need to deploy with confidence.

## Managed MongoDB on GCP

Defang now supports [managed MongoDB](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-mongodb) on GCP through MongoDB-compatible APIs provided by Google Cloud. This integration allows you to spin up a fully managed Firestore datastore and interact with it just like a standard MongoDB instance without any manual setup or configuration.

## Agentic LangGraph Sample

We have published a new [Agentic LangGraph sample](https://github.com/DefangSamples/sample-agentic-langgraph-template/tree/main) project that demonstrates LangGraph agent deployment with Defang. As AI agent development grows, Defang makes it simple to deploy and scale agents, including those built with LangChain or LangGraph. You can explore the example to see how it works in practice.

## Events and Community

In July, we hosted the [Bière & Code & Beer MTL](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350573195004952578) during Startupfest in Montreal. It was an incredible evening with great energy, tech conversations, and the chance to connect with so many talented builders over drinks.

We are excited to see what you will deploy with Defang next. Join our [Discord](https://s.defang.io/discord) to ask questions, get support, and share your builds with the community.

More coming in August.
