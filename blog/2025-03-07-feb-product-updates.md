1. **Unified auth between Portal and CLI:** As part of the work to Deploy Defang with Defang, we revamped and greatly simplified our identity and authentication implementation. One benefit of this work is that users wonâ€™t have to authorize 2 separate apps in GitHub (one for the CLI and another for the Portal), which provides a more streamlined experience. This work also enables us to add other identity providers in the future.
