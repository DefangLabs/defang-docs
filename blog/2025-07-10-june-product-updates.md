![Defang Compose Update](/img/defang-compose-update.webp)

June was a big month at Defang. We rolled out powerful features across our CLI, Playground, and Portal, expanded support for both AWS and GCP, and introduced new tools to help you ship faster and smarter. From real-time cloud cost estimation to internal infra upgrades and community highlights, here’s everything we accomplished.

## 🚀 Live AWS Cost Estimation

We just launched something we’re really excited about: live AWS cost estimation before you deploy.
Most devs ship to the cloud without knowing what it’s going to cost and that’s exactly the problem we’re solving. With Defang, you can now estimate the cost of deployment of an Docker Compose application and choose the deployment mode - affordable / balanced / high_availability - that best suits your needs.

👉 [Check out the docs](https://docs.defang.io/docs/tutorials/estimating-aws-deployment-costs)

## 🧠 CrewAI + Defang Starter Kit

In June, we launched a full-stack starter kit for building real-time RAG and multi-agent apps with CrewAI + Defang.
It’s designed to help you move fast with a production-style setup — including Django, Celery, Channels, Postgres (with pgvector), Redis for live updates, and Dockerized model runners you can easily customize. CrewAI handles the agent workflows, and with Defang, you can deploy the whole thing to the cloud in a single command.
Whether you’re building a smart Q&A tool or a multi-agent research assistant, this stack gives you everything you need to get started.

## 📊 Deployment Info in Portal

We’ve added active deployment information to the Defang Portal. You can now see your currently active deployments across various cloud providers and understand the details of each, while still managing your cloud environments through the provider’s own tools (e.g. the AWS Console).

## ☁️ Playground Now Runs on AWS + GCP

Internally, we also hit a big milestone: The Defang Playground now runs on both AWS and GCP, showing the power of Defang’s multi-cloud infrastructure. We’ve also enabled load balancing between the two platforms and plan to share a detailed blog post on how it works soon.

## 🧩 VS Code Extension Released

We also released the Defang VS Code Extension, making it even easier to deploy and manage cloud apps right from your editor. No terminal needed.

- One-click deploy
- Built-in tools to manage services
- Zero config, fast setup

## 💬 Ask Defang via Intercom

You can now try out the Ask Defang chatbot directly within Intercom! This new integration makes it easier than ever to get instant answers and support while you work. Ask Defang itself is deployed using Defang to our own cloud infrastructure.

## 🐳 Docker x Defang White Paper

And one more thing: bridging local development and cloud deployment just got easier. We’ve published white papers on how Defang extends Docker Compose and GCP workflows to the cloud — using familiar tools at scale. An AWS white paper is coming soon.
👉 [Read the white paper here](https://defang.io/whitepapers/docker-compose-defang/)

## Events and Community

In June, we showcased a powerful new demo at AWS events: “What If You Could See AWS Costs Before You Deployed?” Jordan Stephens walked through how to go from Docker Compose to AWS infra with real-time cost estimates and easy teardown, all via Defang.

We can’t wait to see what you deploy with Defang.
