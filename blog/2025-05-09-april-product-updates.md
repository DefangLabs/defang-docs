![Defang Compose Update](/img/defang-compose-update.webp)

April flew by with big momentum at Defang. From deeper investments in the **Model Context Protocol** (MCP), to deploying LLM-based inferencing apps, to live demos of **Vibe Deploying**, we're making it easier than ever to go from idea to cloud.

## MCP + Vibe Deploying

This month we focused on making cloud deployments as easy as writing a prompt. Our latest Vibe Deploying [blog](https://defang.io/blog) shows how you can launch full-stack apps right from your IDE just by chatting.

Whether you're working in **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **VS Code**, or **Claude**, Defang's **MCP** integration lets you deploy to the cloud just as easily as conversing with the AI to generate your app. For more details, check out the docs for the [Defang Model Context Protocol Server](/docs/concepts/mcp) â€“ it explains how it works, how to use it, and why it's a game changer for deploying to the cloud. You can also watch our tutorials for [Cursor](https://youtu.be/Aicqp9QQdwk?si=h891XNIN_f_U2-fX), [Windsurf](https://youtu.be/QU4q1eULs1I?si=nmSrXLqHtHRRlCVb), and [VS Code](https://youtu.be/k8NbeKKzqiI?si=BxDNJOw_zHnL433w).

## Managed LLMs

Last month we shipped the [`x-defang-llm` compose service extension](/docs/concepts/managed-llms/managed-language-models) to easily deploy inferencing apps that use managed LLM services such as AWS Bedrock. This month, we're excited to announce the same support for GCP Vertex AI â€“ give it a try and let us know your feedback!

## Events and Programs

On [**April 28**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/defanglabs_defang-vibecoding-vancouverdev-activity-7323769706681655296-48OA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACNoYXgBadWv4CWLbcKhgSGxWjdmu9e5dFI), we kicked things off with an epic night of demos, dev energy, and cloud magic at RAG & AI in Action. Our own **Kevin Vo** showed how fast and easy it is to deploy AI apps from Windsurf to the cloud using just the **Defang MCP**. The crowd got a front-row look at how **Vibe Deploying** turns cloud infra into a background detail.

We finished the month with our signature Defang Coffee Chat, a casual hangout with product updates, live Q&A, and great conversations with our community. Our Campus Advocates also hosted [workshops](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7319584997319802880/) around the world, bringing Defang to new students and builders.

We wrapped up the month with our latest Defang Coffee Chat, featuring live demos, product updates, and a solid conversation around vibe deploying. Thanks to everyone who joined.

The next one is on May 21 at 10 AM PST. Save your spot [here](https://lu.ma/defang-may).
