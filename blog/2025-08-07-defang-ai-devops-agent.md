## From Vibe-Coding to Production… Without a DevOps Team

Building apps has never been easier. Tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, V0, and Bolt have ushered in a new era of coding called **vibe coding**, rapid, AI-assisted app development where developers can go from idea to prototype in hours, bringing ideas to life faster than ever before.

And with the recently released AWS Kiro, we have now entered a new phase of AI-assisted development called "spec-driven development" where the AI breaks down the app development task even further. You can think of a "PM agent" that goes from prompt to a requirements document, and then an "Architect agent" that goes from the requirements document to a design document, which is then used by "Dev", "Test" and "Docs" agents to generate app code, tests, and documentation respectively. This approach is much more aligned with enterprise use cases and produces higher quality output.

## The Hard Part Isn’t Building. It’s Shipping.

However, cloud app deployment remains a major challenge! As Andrej Karpathy shared during his [recent YC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ):

> "_I vibe-coded the app in four hours… and spent the rest of the week deploying it._"

While AI-powered tools make building apps a breeze, deploying them to the cloud is still frustratingly complex. Kubernetes, Terraform, IAM policies, load balancers, DNS, CI/CD all add layers of difficulty. This complexity continues to be a significant bottleneck that AI tools have yet to fully address, making deployment a critical challenge for developers.

The bottleneck is no longer the code. It's the infrastructure.

## Enter Defang: Your AI DevOps Agent

**Defang** is an AI-enabled agent that takes care of your entire deployment workflow, going from app code to a production-ready deployment on your favorite cloud in a single step.

By understanding your app stack (using Docker Compose), **Defang** provisions the right infrastructure and securely deploys to AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean, following each cloud's best practices.

Whether you're launching a side project or scaling a multi-agent app, **Defang** ensures secure, smooth, scalable cloud-native deployments.

## Defang Deployment Features at a Glance

- **One Command Deployment:** Run `defang compose up` and you're live
- **Secure and Scalable:** Built-in TLS, secrets, autoscaling, IAM, and HTTPS
- **Multi-Cloud Ready:** Deploy to your cloud (AWS, GCP, DO) using your own credentials
- **Language & framework agnostic:** Next.js, Go, Python (Django/Flask), C#, …
- **Managed LLM:** Add `x-defang-llm: true` and **Defang** auto-configures cloud-native LLMs like Bedrock, Vertex AI, and the Defang Playground
- **Configures managed services** (e.g. managed Postgres, MongoDB, Redis) using the target cloud's native services (e.g. RDS for Postgres on AWS, Cloud SQL on GCP).
- **Tailored deployment modes** (e.g. affordable, balance, high-availability) optimized for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- **AI Debugging:** Get context-aware assistance to quickly identify and fix deployment issues

## Native Integration with AI-Assisted Coding Tools

**Defang** can be accessed directly from within your favorite IDE - Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Claude, or Kiro - via [Defang's MCP Server](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/mcp). You can now deploy to the cloud with a natural language command like "deploy my app with Defang".
