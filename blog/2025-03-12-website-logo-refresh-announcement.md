# Introducing Defang's New Look: Website & Logo Refresh

Over the last couple of years, as we have building Defang, we've learnt a lot about the key needs of developers in deploying their applications to the cloud - the primacy of a simple developer experience, while at the same time providing a flexible and production-ready solution that can work seamlessly with all of the popular cloud platform targets.

In response, we have been constantly evolving our product functionality to address those needs in the simplest yet most powerful way we can come up with. While certainly there is a long way to go, we have definitely come a long way since we started.

## Why the Refresh?

As we reflected on our journey, we realized our branding and messaging needed to better reflect Defang's current value-proposition. That's why today, we're excited to unveil our brand refresh, our first since the early days of Defang.

## Here's what's new:

### 1. Refining Our Messaging

As Defang evolves, so does our message:

- **Our Promise**: Develop Anything, Deploy Anywhere.
- **What We Enable**: Any App, Any Stack, Any Cloud.
- **How It Works**: Take your app from Docker Compose to a secure, scalable deployment on your favorite cloud in minutes.

### 2. A Sleek New Logo

We've modernized our logo while keeping the core hexagonal design. The new look symbolizes Defang's role in seamlessly deploying any cloud applications to any cloud.

### 3. A Redesigned Website

We've refreshed our website with a sleek, intuitive design and a modern user experience to better showcase Defang's capabilities.

## Rolling Out the Refresh

Starting today, you'll see these updates across our [Defang.io](https://defang.io) homepage and social media platforms ([Twitter](https://x.com/DefangLabs), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/defanglabs), [Discord](https://s.defang.io/discord), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/defanglabs.bsky.social)). In the coming days, we'll extend this refresh across all our digital assets.
