## Introduction

n8n is a powerful open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect various applications and services together. Defang is your DevOps agent that can deploy any app to any cloud in a single step. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of deploying n8n to your AWS account using Defang.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- A Defang account (sign up at [defang.io](http://defang.io))
- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of command-line interface

## Step 1: Install Defang CLI

First, install the Defang CLI tool on your system:

```bash
eval "$(curl -fsSL s.defang.io/install)"
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
defang version
```

## Step 2: Clone the n8n Sample on Defang

Create a new directory for your n8n deployment:

```bash
defang new n8n
cd n8n
```

Once you choose the n8n sample, it'll clone the n8n sample for you.

## Step 3: Setup Defang for AWS

Please follow [step #1](https://docs.defang.io/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-aws#step-1---navigate-to-your-project-directory) and [step#2](https://docs.defang.io/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-aws#step-2---configure-your-aws-credentials) in the guide to setup your environment so defang can use your AWS credentials.

## Step 4: Configure your Credentials

For this sample, you will need to provide the following [configuration](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/configuration). Note that if you are using the 1-click deploy option, you can set these values as secrets in your GitHub repository and the action will automatically deploy them for you.

**POSTGRES_PASSWORD**

The password for your Postgres database. You need to set this before deploying for the first time.

You can easily set this to a random string using `defang config set POSTGRES_PASSWORD --random -Paws`

**N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**

The encryption key for your n8n instance. This is used to encrypt sensitive data in the database.

You can easily set this to a random string using `defang config set N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY --random -Paws`

**DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_ENABLED**

Set to true to enable SSL. Set to false to disable SSL.

It is recommended that you deploy your N8N instance with SSL enabled so it would be a managed version of Postgres.

Please enable SSL by using `defang config set DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_ENABLED=true -Paws`

**DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED**

Set to true to reject unauthorized certificates. Set to false to accept unauthorized certificates. Counterintuitive, but leave this as false to allow managed Postgres to work.

It is recommended that you deploy your N8N instance to accept unauthorized certificates so it would allow managed version of Postgres to work. Please accept unauthorized certificates by using `defang config set DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false -Paws`

## Step 5: Deploy with Defang

Deploy your n8n instance using Defang:

```bash
defang compose up -Paws
```

Defang will:

- Build and package your application
- Create the necessary cloud resources
- Deploy your n8n instance
- Provide you with a public URL

## Step 6: Configure n8n Settings

Once deployed, Defang will provide you with a URL where your n8n instance is running. Access it through your browser:

```
https://your-n8n-instance.defang.app
```

Log in using the credentials you set in the environment variables:

- Username: admin
- Password: changeme (remember to change this!)

## Step 7: Set Up Your First Workflow

After logging in:

1. Click on "Create Workflow" to start building your automation
2. Add nodes by clicking the "+" button
3. Connect various applications and services
4. Test your workflow using the "Execute Workflow" button
5. Activate your workflow when ready

## Post-Deployment Steps

### Security Configuration

- **Change Default Credentials**: Update your basic auth password immediately
- **Enable SSL**: Defang automatically provides SSL certificates

### Monitoring and Maintenance

**View Logs**: View application logs using:

```bash
defang logs
```

**Monitor Performance**: Access Defang dashboard to monitor resource usage

**Update n8n**: To update to the latest version:

```bash
defang compose up
```

### Integration Best Practices

- **Use Webhooks**: Configure webhook URLs for external service integrations
- **Set Up Credentials**: Store API keys and credentials securely in n8n
- **Test Workflows**: Always test workflows in a staging environment first
- **Enable Notifications**: Set up error notifications for workflow failures

### Backup Configuration

Ensure your n8n data is backed up regularly:

- Use Defang's volume backup features
- Export important workflows regularly from the n8n UI
- Store workflow JSON files in version control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection failures**: Examine logs:

```bash
defang logs --follow
```

**Port Issues**: Ensure port 5678 is properly exposed in your compose file

**Auth errors**: Double-check your environment variables
