**Introducing Our New Whitepaper: Bridging Local Development and Cloud Deployment with Docker Compose and Defang**

We’re excited to announce the release of our new whitepaper, "Bridging Local Development and Cloud Deployment with Docker Compose and Defang."

Modern software development moves fast, but deploying to the cloud often remains a complex hurdle. Docker Compose revolutionized local development by providing a simple way to define multi-service apps, but translating that simplicity into cloud deployment has remained challenging—until now.

Defang bridges this gap by extending Docker Compose into native cloud deployments across AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and more, all with a single command: `defang compose up`. This integration empowers developers to:

- Use familiar Docker Compose definitions for cloud deployment.
- Enjoy seamless transitions from local to multi-cloud environments.
- Automate complex infrastructure setups including DNS, networking, autoscaling, managed storage, and even managed LLMs.
- Estimate cloud costs and choose optimal deployment strategies (affordable, balanced, or high availability).

Our whitepaper dives deep into how Docker Compose paired with Defang significantly reduces complexity, streamlines workflows, and accelerates development and deployment.

Discover how Docker + Defang can simplify your journey from local development to production-ready deployments across your preferred cloud providers.
