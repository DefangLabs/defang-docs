Defang is aiming to reduce the barriers to entry to cloud application development. With our tooling, we make it really easy to deploy multi-service containerized applications [to your own cloud](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc) with a single command.

We want it to be easy for you to try Defang with as little friction as possible, though, so we have done the work so you can easily get started in a GitHub Codespaces environment, a GitPod Workspace, or even a local Dev Container.

## Codespaces

If you want to get started with Codespaces, you can just fork [this repo](https://github.com/defang-io/github-codespace). It comes with the Defang CLI pre-installed so you can start playing with it immediately. It's setup using the Defang CLI [Dev Container Feature](https://github.com/defang-io/devcontainer-feature/pkgs/container/devcontainer-feature%2Fdefang-cli).

## Dev Containers

[Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are a cool way to provision and configure development environments and share that configuration with other people you are working with. It's a spec that is supported by [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), [Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/dev-containers-for-c-in-visual-studio/), the JetBrains IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/connect-to-devcontainer.html), [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/docs/developing-in-workspaces/devcontainer-json) and others.

## GitPod

GitPod is another Cloud IDE, a bit like GitHub Codespaces. If prefer GitPod, you can try Defang in a GitPod environment by using [this repo](https://github.com/defang-io/gitpod-workspace/tree/main).
