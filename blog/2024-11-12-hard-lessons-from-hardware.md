## My Story of Embedded Systems With Defang

Have you ever looked at a touch screen fridge and wondered how it works? Back in my day (not very long ago), a fridge was just a fridge. No fancy built-in interface, no images displayed, and no wifi. But times have changed, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot about embedded systems, thanks to Defang!

From my background, I was more into the web development and software side of things. Buffer flushing? Serial monitors? ESP32-S3? These were unheard of. Then one day at Defang, I was suggested to work on a project with a [SenseCAP Indicator](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/Get_started_with_SenseCAP_Indicator/), a small programmable touch screen device. Everyone wished me good luck when I started. Thatâ€™s how I knew it wasnâ€™t going to be an easy ride. But here I am, and Iâ€™m glad I did it. 

What is embedded systems/programming? Itâ€™s combining hardware with software to perform a function, such as interacting with the physical world or accessing cloud services. A common starting point for beginners is an Arduino board, which is what the SenseCAP Indicator has for its hardware. My goal was to make a UI display for this device, and then send its input to a computer, and get that data into the cloud.

## The Beginning

My journey kicked off with installing the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on my computer. It took me two hoursâ€”far longer than I expectedâ€”because the software versions I kept trying were not the right ones. Little did I know that I would encounter this issue many times later, such as when downloading [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html), a tool for firmware flashing. Figuring out what not to install had become a highly coveted skill. 

The next part was writing software to display images and text. This was slightly less of a problem thanks to forums of users who had done the exact same thing several years ago. One tool I used was [Squareline Studio](https://squareline.io/), a UX/UI design tool for embedded devices. With a bit of trial and error, I got a simple static program displayed onto the device. Not half bad looking either. Hereâ€™s what it looked like:

## The Middle

Now came the networking part. Over wifi, I set up a Flask (Python) server on my computer to receive network pings from the SenseCAP Indicator. I used a library called [ArduinoHTTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoHttpClient). At first, I wanted to ping the server each time a user touched the screen. Then came driver problems, platform incompatibilities, deprecated librariesâ€¦

â€¦ After weeks of limited progress due to resurfacing issues, I decided to adjust my goal to send pings on a schedule of every 5 seconds, rather than relying on user input. I changed the UI to be more colorful, and for good reason. Now, each network ping appears with a message on the screen. Can you look closely to see what it says?

This is what the Flask server looked like on my computer as it got pinged:

Hooray! Once everything was working, It was time to deploy my Flask code as a cloud service so I could access it from any computer, not just my own. Deployment usually takes several hours due to configuring a ton of cloud provider settings. But I ainâ€™t got time for that. Instead, I used Defang to deploy it within minutes, which took care of all that for me. Saved me a lot of time and tears.

Hereâ€™s the Flask deployment on Defangâ€™s Portal view:

## The End

After two whole months, I finally completed my journey from [start](https://github.com/commit111/defang-arduino-static) to [finish](https://github.com/commit111/defang-arduino-wifi)! This project was an insightful dive into the world of embedded systems, internet networking, and cloud deployment. 

Before I let you go, here are the hard lessons from hardware, from yours truly:
1. Learning what not to do can be equally as important.
2. Some problems are not as unique as you think. 
3. One way to achieve a goal is by modifying it. 
4. Choose the simpler way if it is offered.
5. Thatâ€™s where Defang comes in.
