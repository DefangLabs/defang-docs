We expanded our sample projects for popular multi-agent frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, Autogen, and Strands, validating them on Playground, AWS, and GCP so you can run multi-agent workloads in production without extra DevOps. Our new Heroku migration flow inspects dynos and add-ons, generates a clean Compose file, provisions managed equivalents like Postgres and Redis, and ships to your own cloud in one command. This cuts costs and removes lock-in. We also introduced MCP BYOC prompts so you can deploy to AWS and GCP straight from your IDE.
