With the Defang Pulumi Provider, you can leverage all the power of Defang with all of the extensibility of Pulumi. Defang will provision infrastructure to deploy your application straight from your Compose file, while allowing you to connect that deployment with other resources you deploy to your cloud account.

But since we added support in Compose to specify managed storage, we can fully describe our Portal using Compose alone.
