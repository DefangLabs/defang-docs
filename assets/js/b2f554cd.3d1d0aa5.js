To make it easier to get started, we\'ve added a new way to install the Defang CLI. Now you can use npx to run the CLI without installing it globally. Just run:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx defang\\n```\\n\\nThis will download the latest version of the Defang CLI and run it for you. No need to worry about installing or updating the CLI manually!\\n\\n## (coming soon) Bring Your Own Domain with Let\'s Encrypt\\n\\nPreviously you could bring your own domain with <a href=\\"/docs/concepts/defang-byoc\\">Defang BYOC</a>... but you had to host the DNS records with AWS Route 53 in the AWS account you were deploying to. Now you can point domains hosted anywhere to your Defang deployment and we\'ll take care of the rest. We\'ll help generate a Let\'s Encrypt certificate for your domain and automatically renew it for you.\\n\\n## Windows Support\\n\\nSome of you use Defang from a Windows PC and previously a few features didn\'t work correctly on Windows. Some stuff we\'ve fixed:\\n* ansi color codes in logs\\n* handle ctrl-c when tailing logs\\n\\n## Improved CLI\\n\\nWe\'ve made a variety of small tweaks and improvements to the CLI which should make things a little bit cleaner and more stable.\\n* log messages have been made more clear\\n* adding more progress information during compose up\\n\\n## Stability and Reliability\\n\\nDefang is still in Beta and we know we\'ve got to be rock solid by the time we release V1, so we\'ve been working hard to improve the stability and reliability of the Defang architecture. We\'ve been battle-testing different technologies to see how they hold up and have mad a few changes that should make things even better:\\n* capacity improvements in build queues\\n* improvements in log availability"},{"id":"slackbot-sample","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/slackbot-sample","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-28-slackbot-sample.md","title":"Deploy a Go-powered slackbot with Defang","description":"Hey folks!

Today, I\'m going to share one of our code samples that will show you how to deploy a simple Slack bot. If you\'re looking to connect a cloud service to Slack to publish status updates, or something else like that, this should help you get started. We\'ll walk through a step-by-step process of writing a Go program using the [github.com/slack-go/slack](github.com/slack-go/slack) library to interact with the Slack API and easily deploy it using Defang.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore we dive into the details, let\'s make sure you have everything you need to get started:\\n\\n1.  **Install Defang CLI:** Simplify your deployment process by installing the Defang CLI tool. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.defang.io/docs/getting-started/installing) to get it up and running quickly.\\n\\n2.  **Slack API Token:** Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps, granting it the necessary permissions, including the\xa0bot `chat:write`\xa0scope. \\n![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the bot scopes](/img/slackbot-sample/scopes.png)\\n\\n3. **Install the app in your workspace:** You\'ll need to install the app in your workspace for it to work. Click the \\"Install to Workspace\\" button in the Slack admin UI to do this. Mine says \\"Reinstall\\" because I\'ve already installed it.\\n![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the install button](/img/slackbot-sample/install-app.png)\\n\\n4. **Copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token:** This token will authenticate your Slackbot with the Slack API.\\n![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the auth token field](/img/slackbot-sample/token.png)\\n\\n5. **Invite the Bot to a Channel:** To enable your Slackbot, invite it to the desired channel using the\xa0`@<botname>`\xa0command. In the screenshot below, my bot\'s name actually starts with the word invite, but if your bot is called `mycoolbot` you would invite it with `@mycoolbot`. This ensures your Slackbot has the required permissions to interact with the channel.\\n![screenshot of the slack chat UI showing me inviting my bot](/img/slackbot-sample/invite.png)\\n\\n6. **Clone the Sample Code:** Clone the Defang repository and navigate to the\xa0`samples/golang/slackbot`\xa0directory. This directory contains the sample code for the Slackbot.\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/defang-io/defang\\ncd defang/samples/golang/slackbot\\n```\\n\\n## Deployment Steps\\n\\nNow that we have everything set up, let\'s dive into the deployment process. Follow these steps to deploy your Slackbot effortlessly:\\n\\n1.  **Set Up Secrets:** Prioritize security by configuring environment variables as secrets. Use the Defang CLI\'s\xa0`defang secret set`\xa0command to set the\xa0`SLACK_TOKEN`\xa0and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`\xa0secrets. \\n    Replace\xa0`your_slack_token`\xa0and\xa0`your_slack_channel_id`\xa0with the respective values:\\n\\n    ```bash\\n    defang secret set --name SLACK_TOKEN --value your_slack_token\\n    defang secret set --name SLACK_CHANNEL_ID --value your_slack_channel_id\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Deploy the Slackbot:**  Use the Defang CLI\'s\xa0`defang compose up`\xa0command to deploy.\\n\\n## Usage\\nWith your Slackbot up and running, let\'s explore how to make the most of it. Simply send a POST request to the\xa0`/`\xa0endpoint with a JSON body containing the message you want to post to the Slack channel. Popular tools like cURL or Postman can help you send the request:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl \'https://raphaeltm-bot--8080.prod1.defang.dev/\' \\\\\\n  -H \'content-type: application/json\' \\\\\\n  --data-raw $\'{\\"message\\":\\"This is your bot speaking. We\\\\\'ll be landing in 10 minutes. Please fasten your seatbelts.\\"}\'\\n```\\n\\n## Takeaways\\nCongratulations! You\'ve successfully deployed a Slackbot using Defang. If you deployed this as an internal service, you could use it to send status updates, alerts, or other important messages to your team. The possibilities are endless!"},{"id":"dev-environments","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dev-environments","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-20-dev-environments.mdx","title":"Add Defang to your developer environments instantly","description":"Defang is aiming to reduce the barriers to entry to cloud application development.

He wrote this blog post after trying to deploy an application by himself directly on AWS first, and then using Defang.</em>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nAs a student at University of British Columbia, new to the area of web development, I needed to develop and deploy a web application as a course project. It was already a huge challenge to complete the coding part. I could not believe that an even bigger challenge awaited. Picking the right platform and services is tough to start with. Do you know that AWS offers 200 different services? Lucky for me my professors\u2019 instructed us to use ECS. Otherwise, I would have been totally lost.\\n\\nStarting my project, honestly, it felt like I was hitting a brick wall. Diving into AWS with little to no clue was tough. Terms like \\"ECS clusters,\\" \\"task definitions,\\" and \\"IAM roles\\" were flying over my head. I was scared of messing something up, especially when it came to setting up things like ECR and load balancers.\\n\\nIt was overwhelming when all these unfamiliar concepts came at me at once. I searched them up on the internet and went straight to a top-rated YouTube tutorial. I spent an hour and a half going through the whole video series. Those tutorials, as helpful as they were, couldn\'t fully prepare me for the hands-on challenges of real-life implementation. It\'s one thing to follow along with a guide when everything goes right; it\'s another to adapt when things don\'t quite match up to the tutorial\u2019s scenarios.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/how-AWS-looks.png\\" alt=\\"Example banner\\" width=\\"550px\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n   <em>It could be confusing if you are new to this area</em>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nI ran into so many problems with configuring services. Sometimes it is caused by carelessly selecting the wrong options; sometimes it is due to the fact that I have no idea what the buttons mean; sometimes it is just a bug with my code. Those errors triple the time it took to deploy my project. It was indeed extremely frustrating.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/error-AWS.png\\" alt=\\"error-AWS\\" width=\\"550px\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <em>I have this scary screen when trying to delete the service I created; this is merely one of the many errors I faced</em>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nThen I found Defang (www.defang.io), and it was like someone flipped a switch. Suddenly, all that complicated stuff became way easier. All I needed to do is to install Defang, build a compose.yaml file to describe my application, and run a single command - defang compose up. And Defang even has a Gen-AI assistant to help you write the code and compose file for your application. Defang automatically does all the heavy-lifting behind the scenes - configuring all the necessary services in a secure and optimal way, and automatically building and deploying my application components. No more late nights trying to figure out AWS docs or stressing about getting everything right. Deploying my Django Restaurant Homepage went from being my biggest worry to one of the smoothest parts of my project.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/defang-compose-up.png\\" alt=\\"defang-compose-up\\" width=\\"550px\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <em>with just a single command in the CLI</em>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nWith Defang, I could chill a bit and actually enjoy working on my project, focusing on the cool parts without getting bogged down by all the technical stuff. It made cloud deployment feel doable and fun, even for someone like me who was pretty much a beginner. Give it a try yourself - go to www.defang.io to get started.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/sample-result.png\\" alt=\\"sample-result\\" width=\\"550px\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n   <em>It is deployed to the internet!

While these early customers loved the ease with which they could create, deploy, and manage a cloud application, they had one big request - to deploy their applications to their own cloud (e.g. AWS) account. This was important to them for a number of reasons - to leverage their cloud credits, to enforce their IAM roles and security settings, to integrate new application components with their existing deployments, and more.\\n\\nAnd so, today with our Public Beta, we are addressing this request. With today\u2019s release of [Defang BYOC](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc) (Bring-your-own-Cloud), you can now enjoy all the benefits of Defang **and** deploy applications to your own AWS account! Our Private Beta experience is still available as [Defang Playground](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-playground) for you to quickly and easily prototype applications and deploy them to our hosted environment.\\n\\nYou can learn more about Defang [here](https://docs.defang.io/docs/intro).

We started Defang because, as practitioners with experience in both building cloud apps and building cloud platforms, we were unhappy with the state of the art. It was, and remains, too difficult to develop, deploy, and optimize cloud applications. In architecting and building a cloud app, developers need to consider a variety of factors such as performance, scalability, cost, security, flexibility, simplicity, etc. At the same time, they face a bewildering array of choices - from app architecture to choice of cloud platforms and services, to configuration and deployment, CI-CD, security setting, etc. - in topics that they are not experts in. Clearly, we need a better way.\\n\\nWe realize that improving on this state of affairs is a long journey. Today, we are taking an initial step with the release of the Private Beta of the DOP. The DOP enables **AI-assisted development**, with the ability to specify a high-level prompt and get back an initial version of your cloud service code, which can then be refined further. The DOP **simplifies CI-CD** by automatically building and deploying new artifacts to your target environments when you push new code to your source repository, taking care of all dependency management and build tasks. And the **DOP pre-provisions properly secured and configured staging and production environments** for your application, optimized for security, scaling, and cost.\\n\\n**Try the Private Beta!**\\n\\nTo try the Private Beta, please go to [portal.defang.dev](https://portal.defang.dev) and register. We would love to have you kick the tires and give us your feedback! You can also check out our [documentation](https://docs.defang.io/docs/intro), [samples](https://docs.defang.io/docs/intro), and our [Github repository](https://github.com/defang-io).\\n\\n**Stay Tuned for More**\\n\\nWhile the Private Beta is a start, we have already heard requests for additional features from some of our early adopters and have a lot more in the pipeline! Top of the list is the ability to bring your own cloud accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP). Another frequent request is the ability to access a variety of compute and storage services native to the underlying platform while still maintaining app portability. And we also hear about the need to be able to monitor and optimize an app once deployed. We are already working on all these items and hope to have more to share in the coming months - stay tuned!"}]}')}}]);
