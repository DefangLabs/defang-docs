This will use some default values so you can test things out. You can also see an example of a post request in the [sample http request](./api/add.test.http) file.\n\nThe `worker` service is the queue processor that will process the jobs added to the queue. You can see in the `compose.yaml` file that the `worker` service is set to scale to 2 instances. This means that there will be 2 workers processing jobs from the queue. You can set this to your desired number of workers, but we wanted to show how you can increase the number of workers to handle more jobs.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1.

For production use cases, you should check out the Django + Postgres sample.\n\nThe app includes a management command which is run on startup to create a superuser with the username `admin` and password `admin`. This means you can login to the admin interface at `/admin/` and see the Django admin interface without any additional steps. The `example_app` is already registered and the `Todo` model is already set up to be managed in the admin interface.\n\nThe Dockerfile and compose files are already set up for you and are ready to be deployed. Serving is done using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) and uses [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for static files.

These config values are environment variables that the Slackbot needs to function correctly. The values are:\n\n- `SLACK_TOKEN`: This is the token you copied previously for the Slack API.\n- `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`: This is the ID of the Slack channel where the bot will post messages.\n\nYou can set these config parameters using the `defang config set` command. Here's how:\n\n```sh\ndefang config set --name SLACK_TOKEN --value your_slack_token\ndefang config set --name SLACK_CHANNEL_ID --value your_slack_channel_id\n```\n\n## Deploy\n\nIf you have environment variables configured for your [own cloud account](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc), this will deploy the application to your cloud account, otherwise it will deploy to the Defang playground.\n\n```sh\ndefang compose up\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the Slackbot is deployed, you can send a POST request to the `/` endpoint with a JSON body containing the message you want to post to the Slack channel. Here's an example:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'https://raphaeltm-bot--8080.prod1.defang.dev/' \\\n  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data-raw $'{\"message\":\"This is your bot speaking. We\\'ll be landing in 10 minutes.

    "readme": "# Hasura & Postgres\n\nThis sample project demonstrates how to deploy Hasura with Defang and connect it to a Postgres database. We also demonstrate how to run a Postgres container during development and how to switch over to a managed postgres service like RDS, Neon, or others in production. If you want to get a compatible database ready to go really quickly for free, [Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a quick and easy way to go. The sample populates the database with some sample data so you can quickly start playing with the Hasura console. It sets wide open permissions on the tables as well so you can start querying or mutating the data right away.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)\n2. Have a managed database service configured and have the connection string ready.\n3. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) authenticated with your AWS account\n4. (Optional - for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n5. (Optional) [Install the Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/) to create migrations and update metadata for your Hasura GraphQL api.\n\n## Development\n\nFor development, we use a Postgres container. The Postgres container is defined in the `compose.dev.yaml` file. The Hasura container is defined in the `compose.yaml` file, with some overrides in the `compose.dev.yaml` file so it can correctly connect to the development database container.\n\nTo start the development environment, run `docker compose -f ./compose.yaml -f ./compose.dev.yaml up`. This will start the Postgres container and the Hasura container. The Hasura console will be available at `http://localhost:8080` with the password `password`.\n**Note:** _If you want to make changes to your database, permissions, etc. you should use the Hasura console and the Hasura CLI to make those changes. See the next section for more information._\n\n### Editing the database/permissions etc.\n\nIf you want to edit the database, permissions, or any other Hasura settings such that you can deploy them to production, you should [install the Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/). Then, after starting the development environment, you can run `hasura console` _inside the `./hasura` directory_. This will open the Hasura console in your browser. Any changes you make in the console will be saved to the `migrations` and `metadata` directories. When you run `defang compose up` these changes will be applied to the production environment.\n\n## Deploying\n\n1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`\n2. Add your connection string as a defang config value by typing `defang config set HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` and pasting your connection string (which should be in the format `postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname`)\n3. Setup a password for hasura by typing `defang config set HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` and adding a password you would like to login with.\n4. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.\n5. Your app will be running within a few minutes.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Hasura & Postgres\n\nShort Description: A sample project demonstrating how to deploy Hasura with Defang and connect it to a Postgres database\n\nTags: hasura, graphql, postgres, database\n\nLanguages: sql, graphql\n",

We use a connection string to connect Neon to your code. By replacing the pre-configured connection string at .env and at the compose file to yours, you will be ready to deploy this sample with Neon.\n\n## Essential Setup Files\n\n1. Download [Defang CLI] (https://github.com/defang-io/defang)\n2. (optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) authenticated your AWS account.\n3. (optional for local development) [Docker CLI] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n\n## Development\n\nTo start the development environment, run `docker compose -f ./compose.yaml -f ./compose.dev.yaml up`. This will start the Postgres container, the React container, and the NodeJS container. The development container (compose.dev.yaml) will override the production container (compose.yaml).\n\nOr run without using Docker by doing the following:\n\n1. run npm install to install the nodejs dependencies in both the `client` directory and the `server` directory\n2. create or modify the .env file in both the `client` directory and the `server` directory with localhost, or create a .env.local to override the .env file.\n3. run npm start\n\n## Deploying\n\n1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`\n2. Add your connection string as a defang config value by typing `defang config set DATABASE_URL` and pasting your connection string (which should be in the format `postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname`)\n3. Update your `compose.yaml` file to replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your username (which you can get by running `defang whoami`. \"Tenant\" is your username.)\n4. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.\n5.

If you need to run any commands in the container, after you have run the command above and started the container, you can run the command in a new terminal:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml exec phoenix bash\n```\n\n## Deploying\n\n1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`\n2. Provide values for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `DATABASE_URL`\n   - `SECRET_KEY_BASE` is a secret key used by Phoenix to sign cookies and other things. You can generate one by running `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml run --rm phoenix mix phx.gen.secret`\n   - `DATABASE_URL` is the connection string for your PostgreSQL database. It should look something like `ecto://username:password@hostname/dbname`\n3. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.\n4.

You can run one locally with Docker:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres\n```\n\nCreate a `.env` file with the following:\n\n```\nDATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public\"\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the `remix` directory to start the application.\n\n## Deploying to Defang\n\nFirst, `cd` into the `pulumi` directory and make sure you're logged into Defang with `defang login` and into Pulumi with `pulumi login`.\n\nNext, head to your Aiven account and create an api token, then run the following command to store it in your Pulumi stack config:\n\n```\npulumi config set --secret aiven:apiToken <YourToken>\n```\n\nYou'll also need to make sure you have an Aiven organization with a billing method attached to a billing group. Get the organization id and the billing group id and add them to your config with the following commands:\n\n```\npulumi config set --secret aivenOrganizationId <OrgId>\npulumi config set --secret aivenBillingGroupId <BillingGroupId>\n```\n\nNow, run `pulumi up` to deploy your application to Defang and Aiven!

It's configured to run on an AWS instance with GPU support. The file also includes a UI service built with Next.js, utilizing Vercel's AI SDK.\n\n   > **OpenAI SDK:** We use the OpenAI sdk, but set the `baseURL` to our Mistral endpoint.\n\n   > **Note:** The API route does not use a system prompt, as the Mistral model we're deploying currently does not support this feature. To get around this we inject a couple messages at the front of the conversation providing the context (see the `ui/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` file). Other than that, the integration with the OpenAI SDK should be structured as expected.\n\n   > **Changing the content:** The content for the bot is set in the `ui/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` file. You can edit the prompt in there to change the behaviour. You'll notice that it also pulls from `ui/src/app/docs.md` to provide content for the bot to use. You can edit this file to change its \"knowledge\".\n\n## Configuration\n\n- The Docker Compose file is ready to deploy Mistral and the UI service.\n- The UI uses Next.js and Vercel's AI SDK for seamless integration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to deploy Mistral along with a custom UI on AWS, using GPU capabilities for enhanced performance.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Mistral & vLLM\n\nShort Description: Deploy Mistral with a custom UI using vLLM\n\nTags: mistral, vllm, ai, nextjs, gpu\n\nLanguages: nodejs, typescript\n",
