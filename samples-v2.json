It is a simple Todo app that uses SQLite as the database.\n\n### NOTE\n\nThis sample is a simple Django app that uses SQLite as the database, which will be reset every time you deploy. **It is not production-ready**. For production use cases, you should check out the Django + Postgres sample.\n\nThe app includes a management command which is run on startup to create a superuser with the username `admin` and password `admin`. This means you can login to the admin interface at `/admin/` and see the Django admin interface without any additional steps. The `example_app` is already registered and the `Todo` model is already set up to be managed in the admin interface.\n\nThe Dockerfile and compose files are already set up for you and are ready to be deployed. Serving is done using [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) and uses [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for static files. The `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` setting is configured to allow the app to run on a `defang.dev` subdomain.\n\n## Essential Setup Files\n1. A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) to describe the basic image of your applications.\n2. A [docker-compose file](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/compose) to define and run multi-container Docker applications.\n3. A [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files) file to comply with the size limit (10MB).\n\n## Prerequisite\n1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)\n2. If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc), make sure you have properly [authenticated your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)\nPlus, make sure that you have properly set your environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.\n\n## A Step-by-Step Guide\n1. (optional) If you are using Defang BYOC, make sure to update the `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` setting in the `settings.py` file to include an appropriate domain.\n2.

These config values are environment variables that the Slackbot needs to function correctly. The values are:\n\n- `SLACK_TOKEN`: This is the token you copied previously for the Slack API.\n- `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`: This is the ID of the Slack channel where the bot will post messages.\n\nYou can set these config parameters using the `defang config set` command. Here's how:\n\n```sh\ndefang config set --name SLACK_TOKEN --value your_slack_token\ndefang config set --name SLACK_CHANNEL_ID --value your_slack_channel_id\n```\n\n## Deploy\n\nIf you have environment variables configured for your [own cloud account](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc), this will deploy the application to your cloud account, otherwise it will deploy to the Defang playground.\n\n```sh\ndefang compose up\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the Slackbot is deployed, you can send a POST request to the `/` endpoint with a JSON body containing the message you want to post to the Slack channel. Here's an example:\n\n```sh\ncurl 'https://raphaeltm-bot--8080.prod1.defang.dev/' \\\n  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data-raw $'{\"message\":\"This is your bot speaking.

We also demonstrate how to run a Postgres container during development and how to switch over to a managed postgres service like RDS, Neon, or others in production. If you want to get a compatible database ready to go really quickly for free, [Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a quick and easy way to go. The sample populates the database with some sample data so you can quickly start playing with the Hasura console. It sets wide open permissions on the tables as well so you can start querying or mutating the data right away.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)\n2. Have a managed database service configured and have the connection string ready.\n3. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) authenticated with your AWS account\n4. (Optional - for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n5. (Optional) [Install the Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/) to create migrations and update metadata for your Hasura GraphQL api.\n\n\n\n## Development\n\nFor development, we use a Postgres container. The Postgres container is defined in the `compose.dev.yaml` file. The Hasura container is defined in the `compose.yaml` file, with some overrides in the `compose.dev.yaml` file so it can correctly connect to the development database container. \n\nTo start the development environment, run `docker compose -f ./compose.yaml -f ./compose.dev.yaml up`. This will start the Postgres container and the Hasura container. The Hasura console will be available at `http://localhost:8080` with the password `password`. \n**Note:** _If you want to make changes to your database, permissions, etc. you should use the Hasura console and the Hasura CLI to make those changes. See the next section for more information._\n\n### Editing the database/permissions etc.\n\nIf you want to edit the database, permissions, or any other Hasura settings such that you can deploy them to production, you should [install the Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/). Then, after starting the development environment, you can run `hasura console` _inside the `./hasura` directory_. This will open the Hasura console in your browser. Any changes you make in the console will be saved to the `migrations` and `metadata` directories. When you run `defang compose up` these changes will be applied to the production environment.\n\n## Deploying\n1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`\n2. Add your connection string as a defang config value by typing `defang config set HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` and pasting your connection string (which should be in the format `postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname`)\n3. Setup a password for hasura by typing `defang config set HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` and adding a password you would like to login with.\n2. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.\n3. Your app will be running within a few minutes.\n\n---\n\nTitle: GraphQL API with Hasura + Postgres\n\nShort Description: A sample project demonstrating how to deploy Hasura with Defang and connect it to a Postgres database\n\nTags: hasura, graphql, postgres, database\n\nLanguages: sql, graphql\n",

Metabase will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\nSince Metabase is a self contained application, there isn't an actual development process, but you can use the development environment to see how Metabase works.\n\n## Deploying\n\n1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`\n2. Add your database connection details using `defang config` by typing `defang config set <CONFIG_VAL>` where `<CONFIG_VAL>` is the each of the following `MB_DB_DBNAME`, `MB_DB_HOST`, `MB_DB_PORT`, `MB_DB_USER`, `MB_DB_PASS` (to set the database name, host, port, user, and password respectively). For example `defang config set MB_DB_DBNAME` and pasting your database name. \n3. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.\n4. Your app will be running within a few minutes.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Metabase + Postgres\n\nShort Description: A simple metabase configuration with a Postgres database\n\nTags: metabase, postgres, analytics, database\n\nLanguages: sql\n",

Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)\n2. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) authenticated with your AWS account\n3. (Optional for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n\n## Development\n\nTo run the application locally, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up\n```\n\nThis will run Phoenix in development mode. If you need to run any commands in the container, after you have run the command above and started the container, you can run the command in a new terminal:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml exec phoenix bash\n```\n\n## Deploying\n1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`\n2. Provide values for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `DATABASE_URL`\n    - `SECRET_KEY_BASE` is a secret key used by Phoenix to sign cookies and other things. You can generate one by running `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml run --rm phoenix mix phx.gen.secret`\n    - `DATABASE_URL` is the connection string for your PostgreSQL database. It should look something like `ecto://username:password@hostname/dbname`\n3. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI.\n4.

When we deploy our service to [Defang](https://defang.io/), we also deploy a Postgres service and database using [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) so we can run our full application in the cloud.\n\n## Running Locally\n\n\nTo run this example locally, you'll need to have a Postgres database. You can run one locally with Docker:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres\n```\n\nCreate a `.env` file with the following:\n\n```\nDATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public\"\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the `remix` directory to start the application.\n\n\n## Deploying to Defang\n\nFirst, `cd` into the `pulumi` directory and make sure you're logged into Defang with `defang login` and into Pulumi with `pulumi login`.\n\nNext, head to your Aiven account and create an api token, then run the following command to store it in your Pulumi stack config:\n\n```\npulumi config set --secret aiven:apiToken <YourToken>\n```\n\nYou'll also need to make sure you have an Aiven organization with a billing method attached to a billing group. Get the organization id and the billing group id and add them to your config with the following commands:\n\n```\npulumi config set --secret aivenOrganizationId <OrgId>\npulumi config set --secret aivenBillingGroupId <BillingGroupId>\n```\n\nNow, run `pulumi up` to deploy your application to Defang and Aiven! Head to the [portal](https://portal.defang.dev) to check on status, or run `defang services`.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Full Stack Defang + Pulumi Example w/ Remix and Postgres\n\nShort Description: A full stack example using Remix, Prisma, and Aiven\n\nTags: full stack, remix, prisma, aiven, postgres, pulumi\n\nLanguages: nodejs, sql, typescript\n",

You'll need a Hugging Face token to begin.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Hugging Face token\n\n## Steps\n\n1. **Set the Hugging Face Token**\n\n   First, set the Hugging Face token using the `defang config` command.\n\n   ```bash\n   defang config set --name HF_TOKEN\n   ```\n\n2. **Launch with Defang Compose**\n\n   Run the following command to start the services:\n\n   ```bash\n   defang compose up\n   ```\n\n   The provided `compose.yaml` file includes the Mistral service. It's configured to run on an AWS instance with GPU support. The file also includes a UI service built with Next.js, utilizing Vercel's AI SDK.\n\n   > **OpenAI SDK:** We use the OpenAI sdk, but set the `baseURL` to our Mistral endpoint.\n\n   > **Note:** The API route does not use a system prompt, as the Mistral model we're deploying currently does not support this feature. To get around this we inject a couple messages at the front of the conversation providing the context (see the `ui/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` file). Other than that, the integration with the OpenAI SDK should be structured as expected.\n\n   > **Changing the content:** The content for the bot is set in the `ui/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` file. You can edit the prompt in there to change the behaviour. You'll notice that it also pulls from `ui/src/app/docs.md` to provide content for the bot to use. You can edit this file to change its \"knowledge\".\n\n## Configuration\n\n- The Docker Compose file is ready to deploy Mistral and the UI service.\n- The UI uses Next.js and Vercel's AI SDK for seamless integration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to deploy Mistral along with a custom UI on AWS, using GPU capabilities for enhanced performance.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Mistral with vLLM\n\nShort Description: Deploy Mistral with a custom UI using VLM\n\nTags: mistral, vllm, ai, nextjs\n\nLanguages: nodejs, typescript\n",
